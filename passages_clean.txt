As advanced civilization spread across the eastern Mediterranean, rolls of papyrus were exported from Egypt by Phoenician merchants, above all from Byblos (Phoenician Gubla).4 When the Greeks invented true alphabetic writing with notations for vowels in the late ninth century BCE, they took over from the Phoenicians not only the names of the letters but also the word for book roll, byblos (the origin of English bible), based on the port whence this valuable commodity was traded.      Until 1959, the only ancient book rolls found outside Egypt were in the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum in Italy, which was discovered in 1752–1754 in a sumptuous residence that probably belonged to Cn. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, the father-in-law of Julius Caesar. This collection of about 800 rolls,8 consisting (Nearly all of the collection is now in the Biblioteca Nazionale, Naples.) mainly of unique books of Hellenistic philosophy but also of some equally unique works of Roman literature, survived only because it was carbonized by a pyroclastic flow during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius that buried the city in 79 CE.9 The flow was so lacking in oxygen and at such an ideal temperature that the rolls were carbonized but not totally consumed. They were mostly opened by mechanical means in the 18th and 19th centuries (but were severely damaged in the process);10 they are now being read far more accurately than ever before with the help of infrared imaging— with the best results at wavelengths of about 940 nanometers—that was carried out in 1999 by a team from Brigham Young University led by Steven and Susan Booras.11 Many of these scrolls remain unopened and unread[a].      “There were found many couches, written papyrus rolls, and many other things that ships’ captains trade in wooden containers” (Xen., An. 7.5.14).70 Evidently, boxes of books were already a common cargo in the ships that plied the Euxine in the late fifth century BCE. The top of the anoxic, lifeless level of the Black Sea has historically been about 140 m below the surface (it is now rising);71 objects made of wood and other organic materials are well preserved below this depth because the environment there cannot support life forms that devour them. Bascom was the first to propose that the bottom of the Black Sea preserves shipwrecks uniquely well.72 His hypothesis was confirmed by Ballard’s discovery in 2000 of the Late Roman shipwreck Sinop D at a depth of 320 m.73 Within a few months of its initiation in 2016, the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project had located and imaged with three-dimensional photogrammetry no fewer than 41 wrecks off the Bulgarian coast, including a merchant ship of a type depicted on Attic vases of the fifth century BCE; this lies at a depth of more than 2,000 m (fig. 5).74 The Project has now found 67 wrecks[b]      Its dimensions are recorded as 30 cm long × 5 cm in diameter,84 but the published photograph of it in situ (fig. 11) suggests that it was somewhat shorter. Although this photograph lacks a scale, the length of the bent, dark object lying across the wrist of the adult male skeleton in the tomb appears to be only four times the combined width of his two lower arm bones near the wrist; if the latter dimension was 6 cm, as measured on modern adult males, then the actual long dimension of the scroll was about 24 cm, if we take account of the breakage of the papyrus visible in the photograph[c].8      Fackelmann had not yet done his famous work of saving the Derveni papyrus, and the exigencies of the Cold War might in any case have excluded him      Jstor: Excavating and Conserving Europe's Oldest Books: A Papyrus from Mangalia on the Black Sea          The Mackerel Plaza” (1958). His hero, the Reverend Andrew Mackerel, of the People’s Liberal Church, is a man of wavering faith who once preached, “It is the final proof of God’s omnipotence that he need not exist in order to save us.”      By then, his daughter was mortally ill, and, in the summer of 1959, De Vries wrote to Salinger, “One trip through a children’s ward and if your faith isn’t shaken, you’re not the type who deserves any faith.” In what he calls a “half alcoholic screed,” he went on:  **{: .break one} ** I too have moments of faith, or assurance, or beauty—or maybe just lapses in nihilism.

I work with colleagues in Paris who take a similar approach in mathematics and the history of mathematics, such as my colleague Karine Chemla, who works on classical Chinese mathematics. Did ancient Chinese mathematicians have the concept of proof in the same sense that the Greeks did? That’s another interesting field for a rigorous comparative approach, but the difference is perhaps that we lose the constant. We lose a firm grasp on something we can be sure is always the same.

If we review a band favourably the PRs get to know what we like. THat tends to self-reinforce. Then we tend to feed new stuff in our in box to reviewers who will like that kind of music. There's not much point sending an album to a reviewer who is going to absolutely detest it. So the main thing is, are there writers there who like the type of music you make? Can you identify them by name? If there are, the second level of choice is if the band has some heat around them - by which I mean good reviews, features on other blogs, are touring a lot, have a release. All this collateral support is going to help persuade someone to review the band. The third level of choice is the weight of the record company influence in the blog. e.g. if a big indie like Sub Pop has a big band at the moment, they will use that as leverage to get some of their other bands reviewed. They might give you the chance to review the big band first ahead of all other blogs as long as you review this or that breaking band.      https://www.quora.com/How-does-Pitchfork-choose-what-albums-to-review      “I don’t have the right software in my head to understand what’s going on,” Sylvain Levy, who has a large collection of Chinese contemporary art, said of the latest prices for Beeple and CryptoPunks.  “Art is no longer about a relationship with an object. It’s about making money,” he said. “I feel bad for art.”  (NYT)      This is liberalism at its finest- a reformist attitude that thinks if we can just fix the worst problems- remove the bad apples- get some better regulatory structures in place- then the system might just work rather than internalizing that a system based on fundamentally broken, greedy, hyper-capitalist models is one that will always produce harm.  The only viable option is total moral rejection. Anything less (selling, collecting, posting links to artists selling NFTs, yes even trying to find a less ecologically devastating model) holds up the power of the worst parts of this platform. It grants moral grayzone- an “oh, if my favorite artist is involved, maybe it isn’t so bad?” or a “but I know this person cares for the environment and they participate- maybe they know something I don’t?”  However, we must get there through collective empowerment and strong social programs like universal basic income, universal healthcare, divestment from warfare and policing, a regulated real estate market that does not capitalize on housing scarcity and rent, worker unions, food programs, environmental protections, and actual, functioning income taxes on the wealthy.  Many would call me unrealistic and naïve for this, unwilling to make compromises in the world we are living now because of an idealistic vision of a tomorrow; and to them I would like to say that we literally invented an extra-sovereign monetary system that within 10 years has generated trillions of dollars of worth and is held up with the power consumption of a small country.

The movies I saw or albums I bought or, later, books I read were not much colored by the inducements of culture brokers. The pickings were slimmer, sometimes maddeningly so, and not always sophisticated, but I was never less than certain that I had picked them. This is what makes rural, small-town people so opinionated. Strong opinion is the necessary attendant of choice, however limited, while fashion is the bootlick of exacting coercion.  If I were growing up in Escanaba now, Amazon.com would happily suggest which books or compact disks to buy. Over the Internet, I could chat with people as distant as Newark or Portland, erasing the demarcations of isolation, a visible suburbanite to a vast, invisible city. The Movie People have come to capture Escanaba’s isolation, which exists, still, in every empty street and darkened storefront, but it is an isolation that is, increasingly, identical to that of a thousand towns just like it. All of them are attuned to the same cultural pulsar, as distant as it is familiar, as relentless as it is indifferent.      The lives of the laughing Escanabans are not too difficult for me to imagine. Their cars have shitty mufflers. They are smokers, drinkers, their romantic and occupational histories Iliads of woe. No doubt they have “some college.” No doubt they’ve swabbed enough aircraft carrier decks to have decided that Escanaba isn’t so bad after all. These upper midwestern Jukes and Kallikaks live in a culture which despises them, consume entertainment produced by people who mock them, and it is suddenly hard to fault their powerless laughter at a film in which they will find no representation, not even as tough-talking rednecks deodorized by horse-sense philosophy.  https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-mcsweeneys-books-preview-of-tom-bissells-magic-hours      I don’t think playing video games makes people more violent. You of all people should know that. I do, however, believe playing video games turns people into bigger assholes than they would otherwise feel comfortable being. Games are founded upon competition and confrontation. It’s probably no coincidence, then, that a large and extremely vocal part of the video-game audience responds to arguments with which it disagrees by lashing out. One reviewer of GTA V, Carolyn Petit of GameSpot, said the game was “politically muddled and profoundly misogynistic,” which is very much a defensible position. Petit also made it clear she loved GTA V. Twenty thousand irate comments piled up beneath her review, many of them violent and hateful. Is this reasonable behavior? Sure, if you’ve come to regard anything that stands in perceived opposition to you as in dire need of eradication. What is that if not video-game logic in its purest, most distilled form?  I review books too. Do you know that? No reader has ever told me he hopes I get cancer in response to a negative book review, which I’ve had happen with games. I’ve never met a literary critic who distrusts publishers as much as game critics distrust game developers. I’ve never met a smart reader who sneers at books as reflexively as many smart gamers reflexively sneer at games. Many people involved in this medium hate so much of it and one another. We’re living with the emotional consequences of all this suspicion and rage. The games we’re playing are the fruit of a poison tree.      The vision they peddle of men, women, minorities, American culture, and video games is apocalyptic, vicious, and often highly unpleasant. I’ve never really minded that, if only because watching talented people sweep out the dark corners of their imaginations is far more interesting than watching the handle of a moral puritan’s butter churn pump up and down.      Although still young in comparison to other emergent academic fields—when Game Studies, the first academic journal devoted specifically to computer games, was founded in 2001—the study of gaming has sped through developments and transformations that took decades in other disciplines. The number of dedicated academic journals can already be counted in the tens; the number of book volumes and conferences in the hundreds; and the number of articles and reviews in the thousands. The field has already fought its civil wars between ludologists and narratologists, has several large and vibrant academic associations and communities, and has been officially canonized in academia following the creation of degree and research programs at numerous universities in Asia, Europe, and North America  Jesper Juul, in his now canonical Half-Real: Video Games between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds (2005), emphasizes that video games are amalgamations of the two components mentioned in his subtitle, insisting that both are equally important and that their dynamic but also generally balanced relationship accounts for successful titles. Nevertheless, much of games scholarship appears to lean towards dividing games according to the types of activity enforced by the rules—hence the relative rarity of “science-fiction video games” as a fixed category. This bias is also reflected in the contents of the section devoted to “Generic Aspects” in Mark Wolf’s authoritative Routledge Companion to Video Game Studies (2014), which includes chapters devoted to action, adventure, role-playing, shooting,simulation, sports, and strategy (221-82). With sixty chapters running at over five-hundred pages, the Companion does not have a single section devoted to what Kücklich calls iconographic genres.  Simulating the Future (pp. 140-144)      To theorize a posthumanistic theory of the practice, this article takes as its focus the speedrunning community of the video game Super Mario Odyssey and suggests that speedrunning may ultimately be considered a mode of (post)human performance art.  Hay, Jonathan. “Fully Optimized: The (Post)Human Art of Speedrunning.” Journal of Posthuman Studies, vol. 4, no. 1, 2020, pp. 5–24. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jpoststud.4.1.0005. Accessed 14 Mar. 2021.      There is significant empirical evidence that some types of physical incitement may spur mystical enlightenment. In a matter of a few years, technology may well provide people with a reliable, easy, and safe way to attain mystical experiences. Suppose it were technologically very easy to attain mystical enlightenment by, say, activating an electronic device that temporarily stimulated certain areas in the brain. If such an option were available, should we opt for it? And should we try to develop such a device? I argue in this article that the answer to both questions is positive, defending a position that might be called technological mysticism. Part I discusses some preliminary assumptions. Part II presents arguments for technological mysticism, such as that it would allow more people to attain mystical enlightenment and would diminish suffering and frustration. Part III replies to possible arguments against technological mysticism, such as that it would lead to devaluation of mystical enlightenments or that the technologically achieved enlightenments would not be authentic. I conclude by discussing some of the implications of the claims made in this article.      Landau, Iddo. “The Case for Technological Mysticism.” Journal of Posthuman Studies, vol. 2, no. 1, 2018, pp. 67–85. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jpoststud.2.1.0067. Accessed 14 Mar. 2021.      the CEO of leading game publisher Activision in 2013 received an 800 percent pay raise, to nearly $65 million.  Specifically valuable to this conversation will be Zach Blas’s attention to “queer technology,” useful in thinking about how games, if viewed as queer technologies, have the capacity to “mutate and confuse,” as well as reproduce, the same heterosexist logics palpable in other technologies, such as in computer communications and the design of and functionary relationship between plugs and outlets.10 Similarly, Sadie Plant’s Zeros and Ones explores binary symbolism and numeric representations as conceptual epistemologies tied to, in part, Cartesian duality present in the binary code of zeros and ones, under which zeros are feminine and bear a relationship to the psychoanalytic “lack” of women, conceptually indicating absence, as opposed to ones, which are symbolically masculine and tied to the phallus.11 Likewise, when we shove a plug into an outlet, we are mimicking penetrative, heterosexual sex acts and myopic gender formulations. Interestingly, this particular design—male/female—is not inherent to the way the device operates; it could be stripped of its implicit gendered power dynamics and recast.  Queer technologies are specifically empowering as tools of queer agency. They resist heteronormative culture, the values of which are often designed into hardware. If it is to be categorized as queer, gaming hardware must question and transform patriarchal paradigms.  When they use existing hardware to play nearly all console games and many computer games, gamers are forced to enact heteropolitics. In attempting to control a character or the camera, invariably players utilize the joystick. Joysticks determine the agency players have over the world and over their character: their ability to move and interact with objects and other characters. As such, while game play may be able to critique cultural systems, it is undermined by the contradictory logics of controllers  A productive area where we might begin such an undertaking is with controllers. Input devices, like gamepads that feature at least one analog stick (PlayStation’s standard DualShock 3 or 4 or Xbox’s standard controllers utilize two), map games and gamers to the still-thriving phallocentric logics and perpetuate the conflation of hardware and masculinity (as opposed to software and femininity).23 As a variation of a joystick, analog sticks might be considered as one possibility among many. In short, we must reimagine gaming hardware in order to problematize such ideologies. To do so, we might begin to wonder the following: How would game experiences be altered if controllers no longer assigned in-game agency to phalluses? Furthermore, how could game controls communicate queer experiences—like, say, uncertainty?  We might explore this, for instance, by creating a controller designed to, after each play session concludes, offer the player or the developer the option to remap its controls. For instance, instead of “X” always controlling, say, the character’s ability to jump, it would be perpetually reassigned to other buttons. This reproduces the idea of uncertainty and decentralizes control, while also orienting players toward their own disempowerment  While I do not mean to say that we should entirely do away with present-day controller design aesthetics, I do think we could explore different options, which would allow us to retain the fluid mobility afforded by our dual phallus– joysticks while still disavowing their unfortunate investment in heteronormativity and disempowering cultural systems   (Queer Game Studies)      * Through APIs, insurers can access larger pools of data which permits them to provide more intelligent risk evaluation, real-time fact-checking (in cases of fraud) and reduced underwriting times to their customers. A good example is data from wearables; insurers can analyze APIs connected to wearables to measure “invisible” lifestyle factors of customers (e.g., the number of steps, heart rate, etc.) and evaluate risk tolerance, thereby allowing personalized plans that incentivize “low-risk” behaviors.      Trust deficit: How to encourage consumers to share data          D.H. Lawrence, for example, learned from Williams that "there are two ways of being American, and the chief ... is by recoiling into individual smallness and insentience, and gutting the great continent in frenzies of mean fear. It is the Puritan way. The other is by touch; touch America as she is; dare to touch her! And this is the heroic way."  Poetry Foundation on William Carlos Williams      These three puzzles – how the Universe began, what dark matter is, and what dark energy consists of – make a compelling science case for future particle accelerators, observatories and satellite missions. Indeed, this decade already promises to be one of plenty on the observational front. A number of telescopes and satellite missions will be assembled and launched with the stated goal of mapping the Universe; discussions are underway to build a more powerful particle accelerator than the LHC; and new gravitational-wave observatories are being designed as we speak. With all of these new instruments, there’ll be much more data than we ever imagined, which might help us understand what’s going on with the Universe.  Except there’s a real risk that, even after spending all this time and money, we won’t really understand more about the Universe than we already do. By going down the route of building bigger and better instruments, sure, our measurements will be much more precise. However, there remains a possibility that all we’ll attain is yet more confidence that there’s some form of dark matter, some form of dark energy, and that the beginning of the Universe did undergo inflation. But we still won’t know what the dark matter or dark energy is, or what drove inflation. We’ll have a much more precise statement about our ignorance but nothing more.      I’ve spent most of my adult life staring at the cosmic chasm – the abyss between what we know and what we don’t. And while our knowledge of the Universe has improved dramatically in that time, our ignorance has become only more focused. We’re no closer to answering the big questions about dark matter, dark energy and the origins of the Universe than when I started out. This isn’t for lack of trying, and a titanic effort is now underway to try and figure out all these mysterious aspects of the Universe. But there’s no guarantee we’ll succeed, and we might end up never really grasping how the Universe works. That’s why we need to be creative and to explore. As Einstein once said: ‘Let the people know that a new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels.’ While bridging the cosmic chasm might not be a matter of survival, undoubtedly it’s one of the most pressing challenges of modern science.  https://aeon.co/essays/we-are-at-a-crossroads-in-the-search-for-a-new-physics      Life insurance is a lot like love: selfless and simple.

And it was present in staggering quantities: By various estimates, the inhabited subsurface realm has twice the volume of the oceans and holds on the order of 1030 cells, making it one of the biggest habitats on the planet, as well as one of the oldest and most diverse.  Researchers are still trying to understand how most of the life down there survives. Sunlight for photosynthesis cannot reach such depths, and the meager amount of organic carbon food that does is often quickly exhausted. Unlike communities of organisms that dwell near hydrothermal vents on the seafloor or within continental regions warmed by volcanic activity, ecosystems here generally can’t rely on the high-temperature processes that support some subsurface life independent of photosynthesis; these microbes must hang on in deep cold and darkness  They find evidence that, much as the sun’s nuclear fusion reactions provide energy to the surface world, a different kind of nuclear process — radioactive decay — can sustain life deep below the surface. Radiation from unstable atoms in rocks can split water molecules into hydrogen and chemically reactive peroxides and radicals; some cells can use the hydrogen as fuel directly, while the remaining products turn minerals and other surrounding compounds into additional energy sources.  Although these radiolytic reactions yield energy far more slowly than the sun and underground thermal processes, the researchers have shown that they are fast enough to be key drivers of microbial activity in a broad range of settings — and that they are responsible for a diverse pool of organic molecules and other chemicals important to life. According to Jack Mustard, a planetary geologist at Brown University who was not involved in the new work, the radiolysis explanation has “opened up whole new vistas” into what life could look like, how it might have emerged on an early Earth, and where else in the universe it might one day be found.              https://www.quantamagazine.org/radioactivity-may-fuel-life-deep-underground-and-inside-other-worlds-20210524/      Several sources told the Guardian that Barrowman did indeed repeatedly expose himself on set, although they stressed the context was different to the sexually predatory behaviour Clarke is accused of. Barrowman is gay, and his actions were described as misjudged “larking about” and “joking”.  However, some Doctor Who crew members described an overly relaxed, at times unprofessional culture on set in the early seasons of the show. “David [Tennant, who joined the show in season 2] behaved impeccably,” said Jenna, “and to a certain extent, I think that helped rein things in.”  Montaigne, On Cannibals      H AVING surveyed, during his invasion of Italy, the marshalling of the army that the Romans had set out against him, King Pyrrhus remarked: 'I do not know what barbarians these are' - for so the Greeks called all foreign nations - 'but the ordering of the army before me has nothing barbarous about it.'      We grasp at everything, but catch nothing except wind.      Men of intelligence notice more things and view them more carefully, but they comment on them; and to establish and substantiate their interpretation, they cannot refrain from altering the facts a little. They never present things just as they are but twist and disguise them to conform to the point of view from which they have seen them; and to gain credence for their opinion and make it attractive, they do not mind adding something of their own, or extending and amplifying. We need either a very truthful man, or one so ignorant that he has no material with which to construct false theories and make them credible: a man wedded to no idea.      I do not believe, from what I have been told about this people, that there is anything barbarous or savage about them, except that we all call barbarous anything that is contrary to our own habits. Indeed we seem to 108 ON CANNIBALS have no other criterion of truth and reason than the type and kind of opinions and customs current in the land where we live.      These people are wild in the same way as we say that fruits are wild, when nature has produced them by herself and in her ordinary way; whereas, in fact, it is those that we have artificially modified, and removed from the common order, that we ought to call wild. In the former, the true, most useful, and natural virtues and properties are alive and vigorous; in the latter we have bastardized them, and adapted them only to the gratification of our corrupt taste.      With all our efforts we cannot imitate the nest of the very smallest bird, its structure, its beauty, or the suitability of its form, nor even the web of the lowly spider. All things, said Plato, are produced either by nature, or by chance, or by art; the greatest and most beautiful by one or other of the first two, the least and most imperfect by the last.      They are in such a state of purity that it sometimes saddens me to think we did not learn of them earlier, at a time when there were men who were better able to appreciate them than we. I am sorry that Lycurgus and Plato did not know them, for I think that what we have seen of these people with our own eyes surpasses not only the pictures with which poets have illustrated the golden age, and all their attempts to draw mankind in the state of happiness, but the ideas and the very aspirations of philosophers as well. They could not imagine an innocence as pure and simple as we have actually seen; nor could they believe that our society might be maintained with so little artificiality and human organization.      This is a nation, I should say to Plato, in which there is no kind of commerce, no knowledge of letters, no science of numbers, no title of magistrate or of political superior, no habit of service, riches or poverty, no contracts, no inheritance, no divisions of property, only leisurely occupations, no respect for any kinship but the common ties, no clothes, no agriculture, no metals, no use of corn or wine.

How far from such perfection would he find the republic that he imagined: 'men fresh from the hands of the gods'.*      They ask no ransom of their prisoners but only the confession and acknowledgement that they have been beaten: but there has never been one, in a whole century, who has not chosen death rather than yield, either by word or behaviour, one single jot of their magnificent and invincible courage; not one of them has ever been known who has not preferred to be killed and eaten rather than beg to be spared       For, properly understood, a true victory rests on that point alone, victoria nulla est quam quae confessos animo quoque subjugat hostes. * * 'There is no victory, except when the enemy in his own mind acknowledges himself beaten.'

Valour is strength, not of leg or arm, but of the heart and soul; it lies not in the goodness of our horse or our weapons, but in our own. He who falls with a firm courage, 'will, though fallen, fight on his knees'.* The man who yields no jot to his steadfastness for any threat of imminent death, who, as he yields up his soul, still gazes on his enemy with a firm and disdainful eye, is beaten not by us but by fortune; he is killed but he is not vanquished. The most valiant are sometimes the most unfortunate      I have a ballad made by one prisoner in which he tauntingly invites his captors to come boldly forward, every one of them, and dine off him, for they will then be eating their own fathers and grandfathers, who have served as food and nourishment to his body. … A shaft of wit that by no means savours of barbarism      All this does not seem too bad.

Speakers used to climb up on lampposts. Somebody would say: "We're defending the revolution! We must fight the war until we achieve victory!" Then he would be dragged down, and somebody in a faded trench coat would climb up and yell: "Have you ever been in the trenches? Have you ever tasted soldier's gruel? Have you ever been food for lice? Well I have, and now here I am, a cripple. What do I need victory for? Down wifh the war!"

The peasants who worked as seasonal labourers (otkhodniki) wereoften away for many months of the year, leaving their families totill their land in the villages.

Peasants lived in small and widely dispersed settlements that were isolated from each other during the long winters. The government had little role to play in rural affairs: the land reforms of the 1860s and 1907 were never implemented in the Yanni Kotsonis province, largely because agriculture was a minor occupation for most of the population, and acute undergovernment made the proposition impracticable.15 Merchants, tax collectors, and recruiters made their way to the Northern backwaters, but none of them were welcome. Significantly, travelers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries noted that the Solovetskii uprising of 1668-1676, which combined religious passions with a rejection of an overbearing central authority, was still a popular theme in local folklore.      Help began arriving in 1918, but it was not simply to bolster the local party organization. In February, Sovnarkom dispatched a commission to Arkhangel'sk to seize the vast quantities of Allied-supplied war materiel stranded on the docks since 1917 and send them to Soviet territory before the Allies could reclaim them.33 When the local Soviet refused to cooperate, in part because the Allies warned them that the continued supply of food from abroad depended on the fate of the war materiel, the commission brought in sailors from the Baltic and Arctic fleets.34 In May, Sovnarkom appointed Mikhail Kedrov to head an Inspection Commission and gave him broad powers to "correct defects and wrongdoings" in the local Soviets.35 What followed became known in local society as the "Reign of Terror." Kedrov imposed martial law to facilitate the removal of the supplies, which by July was completed.36 In June, local supporters of Mensheviks and SRs protested against "the traitors and swindlers in power," and forced new elections to both the provincial and town Soviets. The local Bolshevik organization firmly believed that it would lose, but Kedrov's coercion and threats ensured that both elections returned Bolshevik-Left SR majorities.37 The provincial Soviet's new Executive Committee excluded all other parties from the soviets, claiming that power "should be in the hands of those who achieved the October Revolution." The new authorities then implemented the decisions of Sovnarkom that their predecessors had resisted: on the day of the elections, Kedrov disbanded the old town Duma and sent its members to Moscow to stand trial for "counterrevolution"; in July the Soviet banned the last of the non-Bolshevik press, and nationalized all banks, merchant houses and vessels, and deported the proprietors to Central Russia.38 When Sovnarkom ordered that scarce coal and food supplies be sent to central Russia, even the sailors protested.      [facing hunger and rebellion the region makes a deal with war allies for military support and food]  The troops landed forthwith, but after the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Sovnarkom ordered the Regional Soviet to fall in with central government policy, avoid provoking German hostility, ask the troops to withdraw, and reject further offers of assistance. When the Regional Soviet objected that the Allies could provide what Sovnarkom could not, Sovnarkom characterized local organizations as parochial, and again dispatched an Extraordinary Commission to bring the local soviet into line with central policy      In late June the new commissar for foreign affairs, Georgii Chicherin, informed the chairman of the Regional Soviet, A. M. Iur'ev, that the Allied presence was an "invasion," adding that "you have only yourself to blame" for failing to understand the policy of Soviet Russia. Iur'ev's response touched on the heart of the matter: "It is all very well for you to talk that way, sitting there in Moscow."44 Two days later, the Murman Soviet met in joint session with the railway union and sailors' committee, and voted to procure the material and armed assistance of the Allies by written agreement, with or without the approval of Sovnarkom. In the last direct communication between the Murman Soviet and the central government, Chicherin reiterated that the "Anglo-French," like the "Finno-Germans," were "imperialists and class enemies," and that any agreement with them would be "treasonous to the Revolution and Soviet Russia." Iur'ev's response again highlighted how removed the center was from the immediate needs of the region: "Will you give me supplies for the region . . . ? Will you give me real power for the execution of your instructions, [power] that I do not have at the present time?"      Using the Soiuz as their organizational base, they decided to concentrate members in a region where they could remove the Bolsheviks, invite the Allies to land troops, and recruit a Russian army to sweep aside Bolshevism and reenter the Great War on the side of the Allies. That Arkhangel'sk became the primary focus of what was supposed to be an all-Russian struggle was accidental: the White Sea region was the one area where Allied forces could readily land troops and help to solve the pressing food problem.49 The plotters had no intention of creating an autonomous region along the lines proposed by local activists; rather, the North would become an integral part of a liberated and reunited Russia.      The immediate task of the new regime was to create a Russian national army. It would first remove Bolshevik power from the remainder of Russia, after which "we will stand face to face with our real and chief enemy, the Germans."54 But by the end of September, no more than seventy locals had answered the call for volunteers. The government decided on partial mobilization, but the apparent apathy of the local population to the imperatives of war was a cause for great concern among socialists. Their anxieties were reflected on the pages of the socialist daily, Vozrozhdenie Severa, in which the lead articles were often written by the cabinet members themselves.55 "What a happy hour!" declared a lead article soon after conscription was announced; this was the only way for "a great nation" to achieve "respect and recognition . . . The government did what was required by the pressing interests of the state, its honor, and its dignity," and will "allow citizens to fulfill their duty to their motherland." "It only remains to be hoped," the author continued, that the decree will "bring the population out of the apathy" that had permitted the Bolsheviks to seize power in the first place      The town of Baku, which until 1902 produced as  much oil as the whole of the United States, was complexly segregated, with Rus-  sians and Armenians in the central part of the town and Muslims clustered in  distinct districts. Poor Mztslim workers developed resentments against skilled  workers and employers, most of whom were Christians. Armenians and Russians  were either blind to the concerns of Muslims or condescending in their behavior.  By virtue of property holdings and a legal quota on Muslim representation, the  Baku city duma remained in the hands of wealthy Armenians and Russians. Even  though incorporation into the Russian Empire provided a new outlet for educated  Muslims, some of whom turned from their religious upbringing to a more secular  outlook, social resentments festered, particularly in times of political uncertainty.  Ethnoreligious differences defined the battle lines in bloody clashes between Cau-  casian Muslims and local Armenians both in 1905 and 1918. When observers  spoke about politics or class interests the language was about consciousness and  rationality, values coded as masculine; when they spoke about ethnic impulses, it  was about something more elemental, irrational, feminine. In the fall of 1917, for  example, a reporter on unrest in Baku told his listeners: The population ofBaku  and the industrial districts [where the inhabitants were mostly Muslim] feels ex-  tremely nervous about the supply problems. An intelligent attitude is noticeable  among only a few. The dark forces are not sleeping and are using the situation  being created to carry on hooligan agitation.... Crowds of uninformed Muslims  appear with reproaches that no one cares about them. Behind them appears a  crowd of similarly uninformed Russian women, claiming that it is mostly Mus-  lims about whom [the authorities] care. 23 The word in Russian for politically  uninformed was usually nesoznatelnyi, literally unconscious      Yet when decisions had to be made as to  what rights to give to the constituent peoples of Russia, those in power found it  difficult to make concessions to national aspirations. Confronted immediately by  existentml questions of war and peace, land reform, and the future shape of the  new state, the liberal and moderate socialists who came to power were extraordi-  narily confident that juridical solutions could ameliorate deep social and ethnic  conflicts. Women were given the vote, and restrictions on Jews and other peoples  were abolished. The evils that had led to class and nationality hostilities were laid  at the doorstep oftsarism, and it was argued that proper legislation in a Western,  liberal direction would solve all such problems.      In the revolutionary year the  Bolshevik position foresaw giving nationalities a stark choice: either full inde-  pendence and separation from the rest of Russia or becoming part of a future  !!^!air7.socialist,state,w?h alcultural and civil ri§hts guaranteed for working  people.

He warned his comrades  not to repeat the mistakes of the old regime's "Great Russian chauvinism" and to  renounce its heritage of injustice toward the non-Russians of the empire.      Like the famous and influential Polish Jewish Marxist Rosa Luxemburg, they  consistently favored subordinating nationalism strictly to promotion of class con-  siderations. In a class society, she wrote, the nation as a homogeneous socio-  political entity does not exist. Rather, there exist within each nation, classes with  an^agonistic interests and rights. 25 For Lenin, nationalism reflected only the  in^rests of the bourgeoisie; the proletariat's true interests were supranational;  and the end of colonialism would diminish the power of nationalist sentiments.  Nationalism and separatism were neither natural nor inevitable, but were contin-  gent on the sense of oppression that nationalities experienced from imperialism.      In contrast to his party comrades on the Left, Lenin  refused to oppose the Independence of Finland, Poland, and Ukraine. Though he  hoped that such separations could be avoided and reserved the option to oppose  specific moves toward independence on principle, he was unequivocal in his  public commitment to "the full right of separation from Russia of all nations and  nationalities, oppressed by tsarism, joined by force or held by force within the  borders of the state, i.e., annexed." At the same time, he argued that the goal of  the proletarian party was the creation of the largest state possible and the rap-  prochement (sblizhenie) and eventual merging {sliianie) of nations. Such a goal  was to be reached, he optimistically predicted, not through force, but voluntarily,  by the will of the workers.26 The question remained open, however: what would  Lenin and the Bolsheviks actually do ifnon-Russians chose to leave Russia?      In the complex push and pull between national and imperial identi-  ties that we have traced throughout this book, neither proved the victor or in-  spired the workers, soldiers, peasants, or socialist revolutionaries. Although the  nation-form had seemed poised to sweep aside empires and emerge as the trium-  phant political model of the twentieth century, Russia followed a different course.  Imbued with many of the democratic principles of national discourse, the de-  mokratiia understood sovereignty to rest in the working people. They aspired to  dignity and equality—for working people—and participatory and responsive  government. They sought economic rights and, more concretely, control of the  land and factories. But for the most part they did not respond to the strains of  nationalism. Other kinds of affiliation and political thinking made for a forking  rather than one-way road from old regime empire to modern state.  In the borderlands what had  l^been social struggles along class lines rapidly turned into inter-ethnic conflicts.  HjEn Caucasia the danger of a Turkish invasion threatened some nationalities (the  ||Annenians and Georgians) and was seen as an opportunity by others (the Azer-  g|baijanis)      Eric Lohr The Bolshevik Revolutio is Over  the only disputes  today are whether collectivization should be characterized as genocide or just as  one of the worst atrocities of the twentieth century      To see collectivization as  revolutionary makes little sense: it is better seen as a counterrevolution against  the 1917  –  18 communalization of all landholding and as a reimposition of state  serfdom in an even more exploitative and brutal form.      The most dramatic attempt at a Kuhnian paradigm shift in how we think aboutthe Bolshevik Revolution comes from the iconoclastic pen of Yuri Slezkine. Hisstudy of the“House of Government,”an apartment for the most prominentmembers of the Bolshevik elite, is really a comprehensive reinterpretation of theBolshevik Revolution. His argument, presented in literary/biographical/analyticalforms, is simple: the Bolsheviks are best understood as a millenarian sect. Hisbiographical sketches of Bolshevik“conversions”to the revolutionary causeread like a seminary yearbook of conversion stories, often facilitated by closefriendships or romantic encounters. For Slezkine, Bolshevik conversions wereabout entrée into the revolutionary movement and the intelligentsia at the sametime. This for him is crucial.“A conversion to socialism was a conversion to theintelligentsia, to a fusion of millenarian faith and lifelong learning”(37). As heputs it,“to be a true intelligent meant being religious about being secular; asking‘the accursed questions’over lunch and dinner; falling deeper and deeper intodoubt and confusion as a matter of principle; and feeling both chosen anddamned for being better educated, more intelligent, and more honest than one’smilieu”(24).      s several reviewers have pointed out, the book can be maddening for schol-ars. Slezkine’s categorical and provocative declarations come so fast and furious,with so little evidence or explanation to back them up, that the reader is eitherforced into a kind of numbed acceptance, or metaphorically throwing the bookagainst the wall.14Here are just a few examples:“Christianity is inherently‘to-talitarian’in the sense of demanding unconditional moral submission (the co-incidence of God’s will and human desires) and emphasizing thought crimes14Metaphorical because the book is far too heavy and fragile to survive a toss.over formal legality”(106);“Both Jesus and Mohammed were apocalyptic mil-lenarian prophets”(87);“the Hebrew God was thefirst universal autocrat”(79);“the general Bolshevik conception of sin was identical to St. Augustine’s”(405).Then, we’re told in a few sentences that fascism too was a millenarian sect.      Here and elsewhere, Slezkine’s method seems to be that of the novelist—usingallusion rather than logic or causal analysis to create impressions for the reader.His jumps back to early Christianity to explain Bolsheviks are reminiscent ofDostoevsky’s mid-novel jump back to the Grand Inquisitor. He often weaves analysis of fiction in with historical analysis, without clear demarcation. For example, in a passage that I see as one of the keys to the entire book, Slezkine  recounts a passage from Yuri Trifonov’s 1973 novelImpatiencein which afic-tional character claims that the“end justifying the means”was“contained inChrist’s teachings”(974). This incendiary and false claim is helpful to Slezkine’soverall argument, and it seems that he may be cleverly hiding his endorse-ment behind a quote from afictional character. Lord knows. More prosaically,Slezkine’s assumption that readers are familiar with novels that are now rarelyread and in twenty years will likely be read by almost no one will make thisan increasingly difficult read. Big parts of this book are already nearly obsoletefor most of the reading public outside specialists on the 1920s and 1930s, andsoon will become even more so.      In  the end, a typographical exercise would place the Bolsheviks closer to extremist  millenarian cults than to labor and peasant movements of the modern era. No one  looks to Thomas Münzer and the sixteenth-century Anabaptists for answers to  anything today. Slezkine  ’  s book makes a powerful case that the Bolsheviks will  soon be relegated to a similar fate. His narrative about an apartment building that  housed the sect that ran the Soviet Union makes a strong case that the Bolshevik  Revolution is over.          “The Petrograd Soviet officially created the worker militia of Petrograd on February 28, 1917, with the Soviet assigning Bolshevik Alexander Shlyapnikov the task of overseeing the arming and organization of the militia. In spring and summer 1917, the Petrograd worker militias were superseded by the Red Guard, which in late August played an important role in defeating General Lavr Kornilov’s attempts at counterrevolution.13  The extent of the militia’s responsibilities were a sensitive question, as casting them too much in terms of class conflict could provoke opposition from the non-worker social milieu. Shlyapnikov saw the purpose of the workers’ militia as not only to police factory districts, but also to defend gains made for workers during the February Revolution.”      Excerpt From: Barbara C. Allen. “Leaflets of the Russian Revolution.” iBooks.      “When the Petrograd Soviet created a section on militia affairs in mid-March, it removed from Shlyapnikov formal responsibility for links with militias. In late March and early April, he began to advocate a worker “guard.” Shlyapnikov and Konstantin Eremeev, who in December 1917 became Petrograd military district commander, decided to organize the guard in the most “revolutionary” worker districts. Shlyapnikov authored the Vyborg District Soviet’s April 29 decree on the organization of the workers’ guard. The Vyborg regulations restricted membership in the guard to workers who belonged to a socialist party or a trade union, or who were chosen by their fellow factory workers. The regulations defined the main tasks of the workers’ guard as: “1) struggle with the counterrevolution, 2) armed defense of the working class and 3) defense of all citizens’ life and safety.” Other districts modeled their Red Guard units on those of Vyborg. In August 1917, the Red Guard central staff was formed.15  When revolutionary socialists began organizing the Red Guard, moderate socialists and liberals feared that the Bolsheviks would use the guard for partisan purposes. Defending the Red Guard against these charges, Shlyapnikov explained that it was necessary for several reasons. First[…]”      Excerpt From: Barbara C.

As categories inherited from the Westphalian order of international relations break down, a generalized indistinction strikes ‘even the most fundamental concepts, for example those between combatants and civilians, state and nonstate actors, and, ultimately even between war and peace themselves’ (p.18). Left in their wake is an indeterminate condition of ‘global partisan war’ through which the entire world is rendered as a site of conflict riven by ‘gray zone’ operations and hybrid threats that weaponize every possible lever of power. The binaries of war and peace have definitively broken down, replaced by allencompassing calculations of risk and security.              In particular, he takes aim at what he calls ‘informational naturalism’, a belief in the world as an information processor and a corresponding universal convertibility of all things into data. In a rich discussion that encompasses Adorno, Heidegger and Sohn-Rethel, Steuer contends that information represents a process of abstraction of meaning analogous to the prior abstractions of forces by energy and labour by money (p.22). Accordingly, all action in a world dominated by informational naturalism is derived from that world’s translation into data, whether presented on the screen of a Bloomberg terminal or of a military command-and-control system.          The final dystopian endpoint to which informational naturalism tends is a cybernetic melding of humanity and its information processing machines with society imprisoned within ‘an epistemological and behavioral cage’ that excludes any thought or action beyond its parameters (p.24). Human freedom is correspondingly annihilated, with all behaviour taking the form of mere reflex action (p.24). Values and identities exist as only fleeting attachments, instrumentalized for the ultimate ends of circulation and extraction (p.21). All we are left with is the bleak prospect of ‘a kind of dysfunctional stasis, a lingering apocalypse, life as continual warfare, with techno-economic partisans permanently engaged in instantaneous value extraction’ (p.36).              For all our professed concern for saving the planet, the reality is that even worst-case climate change scenarios are well within the bounds of known variation within Earth’s geological history (p.68). The planet will undoubtedly outlast us, perhaps even eventually experiencing the same renewed flourishing of life that followed previous mass extinctions. If anything needs saving, therefore, it is us – from our own selves. While Caygill eschews any treatment of algorithms, one can infer from such unmitigated pessimism that they count for little more than another human vanity in the face of the looming cataclysm: ‘it would take extreme confidence in human exceptionality to believe that humans will, through the technical manipulation of energy and information, find a way of avoiding extinction’ (p.68).              Sara Kendall expands on Noll’s discussion in asking whether a certain understanding of law does not in fact find its realization in the algorithm. Indeed, if one takes law’s telos, its ultimate end, to be a perfect compliance with its edicts such that it effectively never needs to be enforced to achieve the desired behaviour of its subjects, then we may conceivably be standing at the cusp of the moment when autonomous code and heteronomous law become indistinguishable. ‘If autonomy signifies the unity between the law-giving and the law-abiding subject, then at an extreme of this logic, LAWS [lethal autonomous weapon systems] may no longer appear as a threat but rather as a perfect state of self-regulation, as auto nomos’ (p.107).              There is no doubt that one of the defining features of contemporary warfare and one of the main drivers of autonomous weapons is a strong aversion to military casualties among Western states, giving rise to a form of ‘risk-transfer war’ in which risk is systematically redistributed to fall upon the civilian populations of those countries on the receiving end of intervention (Shaw, 2005).      Liljefors borrows from Paul Virilio the notion of ‘omnivoyance’ as the principle of power animated by ‘the will to see all, to know all, at every instant, everywhere, the will to universalised illumination: a scientific version of the eye of God which would forever rule out the surprise, the accident, the irruption of the unforeseen’ (Virilio, 1994, p.70).      Three distinct levels of blindness afflicting technovision are identified. The first of these rests on the principle that any extension of perception must come with some reduction in the quality of perception, a trade-off which means that ‘to see more is also to see less’ (p.129). Liljefors illustrates this by reference to the exponential growth in data attendant to any efforts to increase the reach, granularity and temporal span of military surveillance, occasioning bottlenecks and systemic friction when processing them into actionable information (p.132). A second level of blindness is caused by ‘the opacity of the machine that helps us to see’ (p.139). For as the organs of machine perception gain in complexity, it becomes increasingly challenging to interpret their activity in terms of human perception. Human operators are forced either to take at face value the outputs presented to them by their machines or, if they are to penetrate their black box, turn themselves ‘into a fully integrated component of the technovisual apparatus’ (p.141). A final level of blindness is found in the ‘blindness towards one’s perspective’ (p.146). Liljefors explains that the omnivoyant model of military surveillance, with its pooling of information into a supposedly all-seeing networked infosphere, must be understood as properly aperspectival. Yet, rather than this excarnated view from nowhere constituting an all-encompassing Archimedean point, it is struck by its own radical cecity through an inability to recognize its own delimitation, ‘an erasure of the awareness that one’s field of vision is, after all, necessarily limited’ (p.147).      Faced with such a grim prospect, a retreat to a humanist conception of the sovereign subject may be all too tempting. Such a sanctuary would be entirely illusory. We cannot retrace our steps, nor can we restore by fiat our erstwhile metaphysical certainties. Liljefors appears sensitive to this foreclosure when he suggests that insistence on a categorical divide between the human and the machine and prohibition of any hint of anthropomorphism in our understanding of technology may not be sustainable (p.133). He submits that the very notion of a discrete human vision is itself the product of an anthropomorphization of the human without which its processes must appear strictly mechanistic, a mere ‘system of sensors and electrochemical data processing’ (p.134). And underlying it is ultimately ‘the fantasy of the gaze, the idea that something immaterial – an invisible vehicle of sight – emanates from the eye as a token of the observer’s agency and intent, traversing the threshold between interior subjectivity and the external world’ (p.134). Scepticism regarding the breathless posthumanism that abounds in certain quarters and celebrates the merger of human and machine as the eschatological realization of a technological singularity is undoubtedly warranted.

To this must be added that the humanist conception of the subject has been dismantled as much by cybernetics as by the century of critical theory and anti-humanist philosophy which informs the outlook of War and Algorithm’s authors. Perhaps the most difficult admission of all, however, is that cybernetics is not dangerous because it is false, but rather because, in a very important sense, it is true and it works (Grove, 2019, p.31).  ---  McClendon maintained his innocence, but died the next day, March 2, 2016, in a single-occupant single-vehicle crash when he drove his SUV at 88 mph into a concrete bridge embankment.  (Wikipedia for Aubry McClendon)           Mclntire was the uber-fundamentalist, largely incapable of agreeing even with other fundamentalists. Mclntire joined J. Gresham Machen in attack- ing the Presbyterian Church for liberalism in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Both left Princeton Seminary in 1929 and founded a "true church."2 But Mclntire thought Machen, who did not find premillenialism to be justified by the Bible, had compromised with modernism, and he was also offended by Machens belief that moderate alcohol consumption was acceptable. Shortly after Machen died in 1937, Mclntire broke away to establish his own church, the Bible Presbyterian Synod.3 In 1955, Mclntire was ejected from this church because of his dictatorial leadership style, but his faithful followed him and insisted that they remained the true "Bible Presbyterian Church."4 Mclntire remained with this reconstituted church until it finally forced him out in 1999. So at the age of ninety-two he created a new church, which met in his living room. Never willing to give up, always looking for conspiracies when things did not go his way, and a model of fundamentalist hostility toward modernity, Mclntire might well be described as God's angriest man.5      0s. In 1965 Group Research, a liberal monitoring organization, reported to the Democratic National Committee that in 1950 there had been two nationally syndicated TV or radio programs produced by "radical right" spokesmen. By 1965, though, the number had grown to sixteen. Carried on more than six hundred stations at its peak, Mclntire s Twentieth Century Reformation Hour was one of the most widely heard. Group Research identified two programs, Dangers of Apathy 2nd Citizens Council Forum, as self-designated "public service" broadcasts      The growth of right-wing propaganda in this era owes a great deal to an informal national network of manufacturers of machine parts, dog food, and canned vegetables.      And nowhere was protest against civil rights louder than on right-wing radio. While evangelists such as Charles Fuller stuck to the old-time gospel message they had been preaching for decades, Carl Mclntire and Billy James Hargis attacked the civil rights movement as unbiblical, immoral, dangerous, and communistic      Mclntire was undoubtedly eccentric. He held a UFO conference in 1975, he dreamed of creating a Viet- nam theme park in Florida, and he thought that Nixon, Kissinger, and Billy Graham were hopelessly liberal and soft on communism. But his contention that he was under liberal attack was not simply boilerplate paranoia. The DNC was indeed using the FCC s Fairness Doctrine specifically to eliminate right-wing speech      Mclntire felt that the president had betrayed America by trying to withdraw from Vietnam and by opening up relations with Communist China. In 1 972 his anger came to a head when Nixon welcomed the official Ping-Pong team of the People's Republic on American soil. This was a reciprocal gesture, as China had invited the American Ping-Pong team to visit the People's Republic in 1971 . Journalists dubbed the friendly turn of events "Ping-Pong diplomacy." Mclntire sprang into action, citing a New York Times Magazine feature that explained that Chairman Mao had furnished Ping-Pong tables to the masses in 1952 as part of his war against drug use. Mao advised players to "regard a Ping-Pong ball as the head of your capitalist enemy. Hit it with your social- ist bat and you have won the point for the fatherland." Mclntire organized demonstrations against these "slave players," explaining that "there are those in this country who believe the Ping-Pong players are not here for friendship but to further the Communist designs against the United States."35 Mclntire arranged to have Free China's Christian Ping-Pong team come to the United States to play a series of exhibition matches. Nixon rejected Mclntires request that he personally greet the Christian players, and, in pro- test, Mclntire decided to play table tennis in front of the White House and to lead a team of Peking ducks past the gates. The ducks apparently did not pan out, and the U.S. Park Service would not grant a permit to set up a Ping-Pong table. Mclntire was, however, briefly allowed to play on a legless table carried by assistants. This was sufficient, since the point was to provide a great photo op for the press (which obliged) and pick up publicity for his cause (which he did). He even made the best of the Park Service restrictions by announcing, "Ping-Pong diplomacy has lost its legs."36      The New Christian Right - or "conservative evangelicalism" - as represented by forces such as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Paul Weyrich, and James Dob- son      Though hardly as major a figure as Goldwater, Mclntire was also a "successful failure" insofar as he served as a negative model for the New Christian Right. He was a "fundamentalist," while they were "modern." In her well-known essay on the mass media's narration of the Scopes trial, Susan Harding argues that "the voices of modernity emplot the opposition between fundamentalist and modern in history, producing a naturalizing nar- rative of the progressive spread of modern ideas, at times lamentably thwarted by outbursts of reactive and reactionary fundamentalist fervor."41 A similar naturalizing narrative underpins the common understanding of Mclntire; he represents an outburst of reactionary fundamentalist fervor, confirming what many liberals already believe about fundamentalists: they are kooks. The New Christian Right - or "conservative evangelicalism" - as represented by forces such as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Paul Weyrich, and James Dob- son, has bought into the narrative Harding describes. The narrative enables them to paint their own political endeavors as conservative but not extremist. The fundamentalists at the Scopes trial were represented by outsiders, the mass media that disdained them, but today's Christian Right can control media spin and actually represents itself (when it suits its purposes) as part of the "progres- sive spread of modern ideas." At its peak in the mid-1990s, for example, the Christian Coalitions self-projected image was one above all of averageness. The group's baby-faced leader Ralph Reed appeared on television wearing sitcom- dad sweaters and a big smile. The coalition stood up for average Americans who wanted to express their faith politically, he explained. There was nothing kooky about it. Of course, feminists, AIDS activists, and the ACLU weren't buying this for a second. In fact, the image did not even hold up among many local This content downloaded from 138.16.124.199 on Sat, 16 Oct 2021 14:24:36 UTC All use subject to http God's Angriest Man I 391 branches of the Christian Coalition, where many members saw themselves as radical anti-abortion activists, not friendly moderates.42 If the new nonextremist image was not altogether convincing, it did nonetheless represent a fascinating historical revision. Reed's friendly face of evangelicalism was meant to blot out the embarrassing televangelists of the 1980s. And if politically engaged evangelicals of the 1990s wanted people to forget about Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker, they certainly didn't want them to remember the Christian Right's roots in the extremism embodied by Mclntire      In the past, the working assumption was that the Fair- ness Doctrine protected the speech of nonbroadcasters - citizens whose ideas deserved representation via a precious medium that they could not directly access. That is, Mclntire's one-sided broadcasts against minorities were im- plicitly seen as infringing on those citizens' speech rights; someone on radio had to express their side. In todays climate, it is not listeners but rather Rush Limbaugh and others of his ilk whose speech rights are deemed paramount      https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40068467.pdf?ab_segments=0%252FSYC-6080%252Fcontrol&refreqid=excelsior%3A6d962f3cb2b9c9e1619e9c63d2412383      In his later years, he owned the restaurant Ireland's in Santa Barbara, California. An accomplished chef, he regularly worked in the kitchen and concocted Ireland Stew, combining whatever ingredients were available on a given night. He was also a regular at the restaurant's bar, greeting patrons and buying drinks for friends.[citation needed]  The restaurant failed. In May 1977, Ireland declared bankruptcy.   What would be sign of faith, I wondered-the test of righteous Christian response to such tragedy? The pastor answered without pause: "If you were planning to watch your favorite football team play this afternoon, be faithful and carry on. If you were planning to go to the malls and shop, be faithful and carry on. Fear not. That's what the enemy wants: to make you afraid, to stop this country, this economy, dead in its tracks. But you be faithful, and through your faith stop the enemy dead in HIS tracks."  (​​Encountering the Other: Evangelicalism and Terrorism in a Post 911 World Author(s): Anthony E.

User experience has been designed to resemble  a game, with a series of ten levels through which users pro-  gress and (in the case of its first mission in Peru) sequentially  unlock “content about Peru’s archaeology and history.”  Explorers are rewarded with “Google Hangouts, Facebook  Live sessions and personal messages”from the project team  (Parcak 2019, 222–223). After going through a short online  orientation to learn how to identify evidence of looting,  users are provided with individual tiles of high-resolution  imagery and asked to indicate whether they could identify  evidence of looting. After each user has scanned 1000 tiles,  they move on to the next level, in which they learn how to  recognize “illegal construction”or “encroachment”on  archaeological sites—and are once again asked to find evi-  dence of such activity where they see it. Finally, users move  up to a third level, in which they are tasked with identifying  archaeological sites. Since the project’s inauguration in  JOURNAL OF FIELD ARCHAEOLOGY S3  2017, GlobalXplorer°’s community has examined more than  15 million tiles, covering a total of over 100,000 square kilo-  metres (Parcak 2019, 223–224)           For example, Gupta and col-  leagues (this issue) demonstrate the importance of building  databases with (and in some cases, exclusively for) descen-  dant communities from the ground up in settler colonial con-  texts.

The fear of increased secularization of post-World War I German society was a major factor in the largely conservative and anti-republican (pro-monarchial) Protestant pastorate being largely supportive of the Nazis in the 1932 election.

Press 1992) (citing German church historian: Klaus Scholder, Die Kirche und das Dritte Reich, Band 1: Vorgeschichte und Zeit der Illusion, 1918-1934, at 25 (Stuttgart 1972) (reporting that the prevailing attitude of the Protestant pastorate was that the Weimar Constitution was "godless" and that it was a "state without principles"); Shelly Baranowski, The Confessing Church, Conservative Elites, and the Nazi State 20-21 (Edwin Mellen Press 1986) (Protestant pastors refer to socialism, liberalism, and democracy as "godless").  7. Eberhard Bethge, student and biographer of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, remembers that the common spirit of many Protestant German pastors was to say, "yes to a foreign policy of might, no to a domestic policy of emancipation, in the name of faith." Barnett, supra n. 5, at 15. Since communism promoted the state ownership of corporate wealth and was seen as a godless, secular ideology, capitalism was accepted as society's savior from secular communism. Of course, this binary orientation, positing communism as evil and capitalism as good, helped to clear the way for the fascist partnership of corporate and state power in post WWI Germany. The consistency and cohesiveness of the political alliance between the Christian Right and the Corporate Right in our own time demonstrates the relevance of examining the political beliefs of contemporary pastors against the backdrop of international history and the nexus between pastoral political views and church support of morally undesirable political outcomes. This alliance between religion and corporate power, in its current iteration in America, reaches back to the publishing of a series of conservative articles in The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth edited by R.A. Torrey and fully published in 4 volumes in 1917. That text, largely regarded as the literary spark of the fundamentalist movement, was commissioned by two wealthy California oil men in order to defend conservative Protestantism from modernism and liberalism.

A number of young people nowadays, as one can readily understand, feel that 'modern' ideals and programmes, a very mixed bag of them, have worked out so badly that the traditional ones may be better; but how badly those used to work out too seems to have been successfully kept hidden.      I am still rather ill-adjusted to the change of atmosphere. Lecturing at Government universities in the Fat, East, which means firmly nonmissionary ones, was not likely to prepare me for it; I gathered that those of my students who became interested in Paradise Lost, though too polite to express their opinion to me quite directly, thought "Well, if they worship such a monstrously wicked God as all that, no wonder th_at they themselves are so monstrously wicked as we have traditionally found them."      He is struggling to make his God appear less wicked, as he tells us he will at the start (1. 25), and does succeed in making him noticeably less wicked than the traditional Christian one; though, after all his efforts, owing to his loyalty to the sacred text and the penetration with which he makes its story real to us, his modern critics still feel, in a puzzled way, that there is something badly wrong about it all. That this searching goes on in Paradise Lost, I submit, is the chief source of its fascination and poignancy; and to realize that it is going on makes the poem feel much better , at many po      I I think itlioi-r10Ie and wonderful; rregard it as like Aztec J or Benin sculpture, or to come nearer home the novels of Kafka, and am rather suspicious of any critic who claims 1 not to feel anything so obvious.

MILTON'S GOD simpler brethren are likely to be deceived into thinking that some wrong belief is still accepted, so that they continue to act on it, with very bad effects perhaps; yet more, once the leader has started on the horrible process of connivance, he is liable to act much worse than the simpler brethren would have done. But this does not apply to Mr Eliot; a discussion about an aesthetic preference is eminently the place where the mysterious processes of accommodation should first be tried out, and he decided later, when the controversy had become plainly theological, that he was committed to accepting Milton as a Christian poet.

()      Inviting difference and dissent is precisely what Milton's writings do, so to that extent this kind of criticism is anticipated in his work. The fact is that Milton is both theistic and post-theistic, monotheistic and polyglot-all of these positions at once. For many, this is precisely the condition of our modernity.

What was wanted was the individual man of genius, who has now arisen and who understands the truth. That he has now arisen, that the truth has now been clearly understood, is not an inevitable event, following of necessity in the chains of historical development, but a mere happy accident.

Nobody planned it, and it did not need an all-embracing ideology, whereas socialism was an ideological construction. Ultimately, capitalism is human nature at work - that is, man's greed allowed to follow its course - whereas socialism is an attempt to institutionalize and enforce fraternity. It seems obvious by now that a society in which greed is the main motivation of human action, for all of its repugnant and deplorable aspects, is incomparably better than a society based on compulsory brotherhood, whether in national or international socialism."  And perhaps this was his secret, and the explanation of the way in which he "got away with it" - that he never entered the foreground of others' judgment as a dangerous opponent, but always as a sceptical friend. No alarm-bells sounded when he began his gentle arguments; and even if, at the end of them, nothing remained of the subversive orthodoxies, nobody felt damaged in their ego or defeated in their life's project, by arguments which from any other source would have inspired the greatest indignation.  https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/leszek-kolakowski-thinker-for-our-time-0/          The cia, after all, is nothing more than the secret police of American capitalism, plugging up leaks in the political dam night and day so that shareholders of US companies operating in poor countries can continue enjoying the rip-off.

While enrolled in a spycra lock-picking class, former British mi5 counterintelligence agent Peter Wright encountered a massive cellar room with thousands of keys, me- ticulously cataloged and arranged on walls. His instructor told the class that mi5 made it a practice to secretly collect key imprints “of o ces, hotels, or pri- vate houses . . . all over Britain.” e instructor’s explanation for the collection was simply that “you never know when you might need a key again” (Wright 1988: 51).  In  e File (1998), Timothy Garton Ash described the East German intelligence agency, Stassi’s, massive collection of personal items (including un- derwear and other articles of clothing) that might be of use at some unknown future date if Stassi needed to use tracking dogs to locate the owner of the stolen item.  ese items were processed and placed in plastic bags, then sorted and stored in Stassi’s immense, e cient archival  ling system for unknown future uses. Edward Snowden’s more recent disclosures of rampant National Security Agency (nsa) electronic monitoring establish that the agency collected previ- ously unfathomable amounts of data on billions of people on the assumption the information might be of use at some future date (Greenwald 2014; Price 2013c).  establishing increased congressional oversight of the cia through the Hughes-Ryan Act of 1974  Stern’s revelations led mainstream media outlets to investigate the cia’s use of funding fronts to in ltrate domestic organizations (see Newsweek 1967). Pub- lic concerns led President Johnson to appoint Under Secretary of State Nicho- las Katzenbach to lead a commission investigating cia programs that stood to “endanger the integrity and independence of the educational community.” But with Director of Central Intelligence (dci) Richard Helms on the committee, there was little chance of uncovering anything that the agency did not want made public, and even less chance that the committee would recommend crim- inal trials for cia employees violating the agency’s charter limiting its domestic activities. President Johnson later received political payback for appointing a committee supporting the status quo; “having ‘saved’ the Agency, he demanded its loyalty on the Vietnam issue. His demand produced further cosmetic exer- cises, including an attempt to discredit political protest against the war and the suppression of dissent within the cia” (Jefreys-Jones 1989: 156). But even as the Katzenbach Commission downplayed cia criminal wrongdoing, it con rmed widespread cia in ltration of domestic political organizations and revealed that the agency covertly funded the publication of more than a thousand books for academic and general audiences, as well as magazines like Encounter and Partisan Review (Wilford 2008; U.S. Senate 1976: 189).  On March 8, 1971, a small group of activists broke in to the fbi Field Station in Media, Pennsylvania, and stole records documenting the fbi’s illegal Counter Intelligence Program (cointelpro), which harassed and spied on le ist po- litical groups (see Medsger 2014).  ese records established how groups rang- ing from the American Indian Movement to the Black Panthers were in l- trated, harassed, and at times encouraged to engage in illegal activities by the fbi  e report, known as “ e Family Jewels,” was a 693-page compilation of por- tions of memos and  les that provided a detailed account of the cia’s illegal activities. “ e Family Jewels” described the agency’s involvement in extensive illegal domestic intelligence operations including broad surveillance of U.S. news reporters and American political dissidents (including compiling almost 10,000 pages of  les on anti–Vietnam War protesters); break-ins at homes of defectors, former cia employees, and cia critics; forging of id documents; and kidnappings and assassination plots against state leaders (Fidel Castro, Patrice Lumumba, and Rafael Trujillo).  A few weeks later, in an “off-the-record” meeting with the New York Times editorial board, President Ford raised concerns that congressional investigations could unearth the existence of cia’s assassination programs.   The Times did not report on the cia’s assassination program.  The Rockefeller Commission established that the CIA had read more than 2.3 million pieces of American mail in its Soviet mail monitoring program; indexed 7 million individual names (under Operation CHAOS) (Rockefeller 1975: 24–34, 41); and used the Agency for International Development and an un- named American university to run a CIA counterinsurgency “training school for foreign police and security officers” in the United States, which also “sold small amounts of licensed  firearms and police equipment to the foreign officers and their departments” (39). Despite the report’s admonitions that the CIA should not repeat these illegal and inadvisable acts, no one at the agency was arrested, and no concrete forms of oversight were forthcoming as a result of the Rockefeller report.

(*Katc: Cho, unfortunate1y, was disconnected from the world last year.)      -Prompted by the Bay of Pigs losses, the complex was created in 1962 to provide death and disability benefits to agents and beneficiaries when security considerations preclude attribution to the United States Government. Lawrence Houston, retired General Counsel of the Agency, testified that his office established the insuranceinvestment complex, because his staff was responsible for all problems related to the death or disability of employees during the course of their Agency work. These problems were all handled in what Houston called a very "sketchy way" which he felt was undesirable from all points of view. When the Agency went into air proprietaries on a large scale, additional risks arose which simply could not be underwritten commercially. So somewhere in the late 1950s or around 1960, I think I was the one that posed that we might organize our own insurance entities. 6 A single event served as the catalyst for the establishment of the complex. Houston recalled in latter testimony that the event that brought it into focus was the death of four airmen in the Bay of Pigs. These men were not supposed to have engaged in the fighting and were training on the mainland, but when the Cubans were either exhausted or unable to fly anymore, they pitched in, went over the beach, and were shot down. "Ibid. 'Escrow accounts are established when an agent cannot receive his full payment from the CIA without attracting suspicion. The funds not paid to the agent go into escrow accounts and are invested under the complex. "Lawrence Houston testimony, 1/15/76, p. 61. We heard of this for the first time the next morning and Allen Dulles called me over and said, you'll have to make some provision for the families of those four fliers .... Through [an ad hoc] mechanism we paid benefits to the family for a considerable length of time until we were able to turn it over to the Bureau of Employees Compensation. This was a very makeshift arrangement, and so based on that I came to the conclusion that we needed a much more formal and flexible instrument. And so after long consideration within the Agency we acquired the first two insurance entities which had been in being before and then we flushed them out a little bit." Thus, the formation of this entity represented the "culmination of experience" in this support area, according to Houston. Although the complex originally operated under the Domestic Operations Division, a special board of directors later assumed control of the proprietaries and their investments. In July 1973 control of the complex was transferred to the Commercial and Cover Staff.  The more serious issue, however, is the question of the confidentiality of the relationships among members of the clergy and their congregations. Of the recent relationships, the most damaging would appear to be that of a U.S. priest serving the CIA as an informant on student and reli'ious dissidence      The Patman disclosures led the CIA to take a hard look at this technique of funding, but not to reconsider the propriety of bringing the independence of America's foundations into question by using them as conduits for the funding of covert action projects. According to the Chief of the Covert Action Staff's Program and Evaluation Group: The real lesson of the Patman Flap is not that we need to get out of the business of using foundation cover for funding, but that we need to get at it more professionally and extensively.      At the same time the Agency was withdrawing from support of a large number of domestically-based organizations, it moved rapidly to shelter certain high-priority operations from the Katzenbach prohibitions and to devise more secure funding mechanisms. This process was facilitated by what was termed "surge funding." The Katzenbach guidelines called for termination of CIA funding of domestically based U.S. organizations by December 31, 1967. With 303 Committee approval for the largest grants, the Agency "surge funded" a number of organizations, giving them advances before the December deadline which carried them in some cases for up to two years of operations. Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty were so funded.  In reviewing the CIA's adjustments to the Katzenbach Committee's recommendations, the Committee found no violations of the policy the report sets forth. However, it is important to recognize how narrow the focus of the Katzenbach Committee's concern was. The problem was approached by the committee and by the CIA essentially as one of security: how to limit the damage caused by the revelations of CIA relationships with private U.S. institutions. Many of the restrictions developed by the CIA in response to the events of 1967 appear to be security measures aimed at preventing further public disclosures which could jeopardize sensitive CIA operations. They did not represent significant rethinking of where boundaries ought to be drawn in a free society.      The CIA relationships with the academic community are extensive and serve many purposes, including providing leads and making introductions for intelligence purposes, collaboration in research and analysis, intelligence collection abroad, and preparation of books and other propaganda materials.      The Central Intelligence Agency is now using several hundred American academics 11, 'who in addition to providing leads and, on n "Academics" includes administrators, faculty members and graduate students engaged in teaching. occasion, making introductions for intelligence purposes, occasionally write books and other material to be used for propaganda purposes abroad. Beyond these, an additional few score are used in an unwitting mfanner for minor activities. These academics are located in over 100 American colleges, universities, and related institutes. At the majority of institutions, no one other than the individual concerned is aware of the CIA link. At the others, at least one university official is aware of the operational use made of academics on his campus. In addition, there are several American academics abroad 'who serve operational purposes, primarily the collection of intelligence.2   A book about a student from a developing country who had studied in a communist country "was developed by [two area divisions of the CIA] and produced by the Domestic Operations Division ... 'and has had a high impact in the U.S. as well as the [foreign area] market." The book, which was published by the European outlet of a U.S. publishing house, was published in condensed form in two major U.S. magazines. Eric Severeid, the CBS political commentator, in reviewing this book, spoke a larger truth than he knew when he sug- gested that "our propaganda services could do worse than to flood [foreign] university towns with this volume."   Another CIA book, the Penkovskiy Papers, was published in the United States in 1965 "for operational reasons", but actually became commercially viable. The book was prepared -and written by witting Agency assets who drew on actual case materials. Publi- cation rights to the manuscript were sold to a publisher through a trust fund which was established for the purpose. The publisher was unaware of any U.S. Government interest.

It showed how presidents, through the nsc, the Forty Committee, and at times directly through dcis, used the cia as a covert tool of executive branch policy. As former career cia agent Ralph McGehee later wrote, “My view backed by 25 years of experience is, quite sim- ply, that the cia is the covert action arm of the Presidency” (1983: xi).  e Pike Report concluded that “all evidence in hand suggests that the cia, far from being out of control, has been utterly responsive to the instructions of the Presi- dent and the Assistant to the President for National Security Afairs. It must be remembered, however that the cia director determines which cia-initiated co- vert action projects are su ciently ‘politically sensitive’ to require Presidential attention” (Pike Report 1977: 189).      It has always been much easier (because it has always seemed much safer) to give a name to the evil without than to locate the terror within. And yet, the terror within isfar truer and far more powerful than any of our labels: the labels change, the terror is constant. And this terror has something to do with that irreducible gap between the self one invents-the self one takes oneself as being, which is, however and by definition, a provisionalself-and the undiscoverable self which always has the power to blow the provisionalselfto bits. Itis perfectly possible-indeed, it isfar from uncommon-to go to bed one night, or wake up one morning, or simply walk through a door one has known all one's life, and discover, between inhaling and exhaling, that the self one has sewn together with such effort is all dirty rags, is unusable, is gone: and out of what raw material will one build a self again? The lives of men-and, therefore, of nations-to an extent literally unimaginable, depend on how vividly this question lives in the mind. It is a question which can paralyze the mind, of course; but if the question does not live in the mind, then one is simply condemned to eternal youth, which is a synonym for corruption.      Some rare days, often in the winter, when New York is cheerfully immobilized by snow-cheerfully, because the snow gives people an excuse to talk to each other, and they need, God help us, an excuse-or sometimes when the frozen New York spring is approaching, I walk out of my house toward no particular destination, and watch the faces that pass me. Where do they come from? how did they become-these faces-so cruel and so sterile? they are related to whom? they are related to what? They do not relate to the buildings, 3 Baldwin: Nothing Personal Published by ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst, 1983 52 James Baldwin certainly-no human being could; I suspect, in fact, that many of us live with the carefully suppressed terror that these buildings are about to crash down on us; the nature ofthe movement ofthe people in the streets is certainly very close to panic. You will search in vain for lovers. I have not heard anyone singing in the streets of New York for more than twenty years. By singing, I mean singing forjoy, for the hell ofit. I don't mean the drunken, lonely, 4-AM keening which is simply the sound of some poor soul trying to vomit up his anguish and gagging on it. Where the people can sing, the poet can live-and it is worth saying it the other way around, too: where the poet can sing, the people can live. When a civilization treats its poets with the disdain with which we treat ours, it cannot be far from disaster; it cannot be far from the slaughter ofthe innocents. Everyone is rushing, God knows where, and everyone is looking for God knows what-but it is clear that no one is happy here, and that something has been lost. Only, sometimes, uptown, along the river, perhaps, I've sometimes watched strangers here, here for a day or a week or a month, or newly transplanted, watched a boy and a girl, or a boy and a boy, or a man and a woman, or a man and a child, or a woman and a child; yes, there was something recognizable, something to which the soul responded, something to make one smile, even to make one weep with exultation. They were yet distinguishable from the concrete and the steel. One felt that one might approach them without freezing to death.      For one thing, talking to Americans is usually extremely uphill work. We are afraid to reveal ourselves because we trust ourselves so little. American attitudes are appalling, but so are the attitudes of most of the people in the world. What is stultifying here is that the attitude is presented as the person; one is expected to justify the attitude in order to reassure the person-whom, alas, one has yet to meet, who is light-years away, in some dreadful, private labyrinth. And in this labyrinth the person is desper5 Baldwin: Nothing Personal Published by ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst, 1983 54 James Baldwin ately trying not to find out what he really feels. Therefore, the truth cannot be told, even about one's attitudes: we live by lies. And not only, for example, about race-whatever, by this time, in this country, or, indeed, in the world, this word may mean-but about our very natures. The lie has penetrated to our most private moments, and the most secret chambers of our hearts.      But we are unbelievably ignorant concerning what goes on in our countryto say nothing of what goes on in the rest of the world-and appear to have become too timid to question what we are told. Ourfailure to trust one another deeply enough to be able to talk to one another has become so great that people with these questions in their hearts do not speak them; our opulence is so pervasive that people who are afraid to lose whatever they think they have persuade themselves ofthe truth ofa lie, and help disseminate it; and God help the innocent here, that man or woman who simply wants to love, and be loved. Unless this would-be lover is able to replace his or her backbone with a steel rod, he orshe is doomed. This is no place for love. I know that I am now expected to make a bow in the direction ofthose millions of unremarked, happy marriages all over America, but I am unable honestly to do so because I find nothing whatever in our moral and social climate-and I am now thinking particularly of the state of our children-to bear witness to their existence. I suspect that when we refer to these happy and so marvelously invisible people, we are simply being nostalgic concerning the happy, simple, God-fearing life which we imagine ourselves once to have lived. In any case, wherever love is found, it unfailingly makes itself felt in the individual, the personal authority of the individual. Judged by this standard, we are a loveless nation. The best that can be said is that some of us are struggling. And what we are struggling against is that death in the heart which leads not only to the shedding of blood, but which reduces human beings to corpses while they live. Four AM can be a devastating hour.      Four AM can be a devastating hour. The day, no matter what kind of day it was, is indisputably over; almost instantaneously, a new day begins: and how will one bear it? Probably no better than one bore the day that is ending, possibly not as well. Moreover, a day is coming which one will not recall, that last day of one's life, and on that day one will oneself become as irrecoverable as all the days that have passed.      https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&context=cibs          The modern nation is but a product and tool of the capitalist system of production; it grows with that system, not only in power, but also in extent. The domestic market is the safest for the capitalist class of every country. It is the easiest to maintain and to exploit. In proportion as the capitalist system develops, so also grows the pressure on the part of the capitalist class in every nation for an extension of its political boundaries. The statesman who maintained that modern wars are no longer manifestations of dynastic, but of national, aspirations was not far from the truth, provided one understands by national aspirations the aspirations of the capitalist class. Nothing so much injures the vital interests of the capitalists of any nation as a reduction of their territory. The capitalist class of France would long ago have pardoned Germany the $1,250,000,000 which she demanded as an indemnity for the war of 1870, but can never pardon the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine.      All modern nations feel the necessity of extending their boundaries. This is easiest for the United States, which will soon actually control all America, and for England, which is enabled by its sea power to expand the extent of its colonies without interruption. Russia also enjoyed at one time great advantages in this respect, but the limits of her aggrandizement seem to have been reached; she is bounded on all sides by nations which resist her advancement. Worst off are the nations of continental Europe in this respect; they, as well as others, require territorial expansion, but they are so closely hemmed in by one another that none can grow except at the expense of some other. The colonial policy of these states affords inadequate relief to the need of expansion caused by their capitalist system of production. This situation is the most powerful cause of the militarism which has turned Europe into a military camp. There are but two ways out of this intolerable state of things: either a gigantic war that shall destroy some of the existing European states, or the union of them all in a federation.      Socialists are frequently reproached with having no fixed aims, with being able to do nothing but criticize and with not knowing what to put in place of that which they would overthrow. Nevertheless, the fact remains that none of the existing parties has so well-marked and clear an aim as the Socialist Party. It may, indeed, be questioned whether the other political parties have any aims at all. They all hold to the existing order, although they all see that it is untenable and unendurable. Their programs contain nothing except a few little patches by which they hope and promise to make the untenable, tenable and the unendurable, endurable.      Not until the age of capitalist production was reached did social evolution proceed at such a pace that men became conscious of it. Of course they first looked for the causes of this evolution on the surface. But one who sticks to the surface can see only the forces which determine the immediate course of progress, and these are not the changing conditions of production, but the changing ideas of men.      The philosophers who first endeavored to investigate the causes of social development thought they found them in the ideas of men. To a certain degree they recognized that these ideas sprang from material wants; but the fact still remained a secret to them that these wants changed from age to age, and that the changes were the results of alterations in economic conditions, that is, in the system of production. They started with the notion that the wants of man – “human nature” – were unchangeable. Hence they could see but one “true,” “natural,” “just” social system, because only one could correspond to the “true nature of man.” All other social forms they pronounced the result of mental aberrations which came about only because mankind did not realize sooner what they needed; human judgment, it was thought, had been befogged, either, as some imagined, on account of the natural stupidity of man, or, as others maintained, on account of the willful machinations of kings or priests. Looked at from such a standpoint the development of society appears to be the result of a development of thought. The wiser men are, the quicker they are to discover the social forms that suit human nature, the juster and better does society become.      These statements are not mere fancies; socialists have demonstrated them with the actual facts of our system of production. These facts are more eloquent and convincing than the most brilliant pictures of the future order could be. The best that such pictures can do is to show that the socialist commonwealth is not impossible. But they are bound to be defective; they can never cover all the details of social life; they will always leave some loophole through which an enemy can insinuate an objection. That, however, which is shown to be inevitable is thereby shown, not only to be possible, but to be the only thing possible. If indeed the socialist commonwealth were an impossibility, then mankind would be cut off from all further economic development. In that event modern society would decay, as did the Roman empire nearly two thousand years ago, and finally relapse into barbarism.      In the course of the nineteenth century a great revolution took place, not only in the economic world, but also in men’s minds. Insight into the causes of social development has increased tremendously. As far back as the forties Marx and Engels showed – and from that time on every step in social science has proved it – that, in the last analysis, the history of mankind is determined, not by ideas, but by an economic development which progresses irresistibly, obedient to certain underlying laws and not to anyone’s wishes or whims. In the foregoing chapters we have seen how it goes on; how it brings about new forms of production which require new forms of society; how it starts new wants among men which compel them to reflect upon their social condition, and to devise means whereby to adjust society to the new system in accordance with which production is carried on. For, we must always remember, this process of adjustment does not proceed of itself; it needs the aid of the human brain. Without thought, without ideas, there is no progress. But ideas are only the means to social development; the first impulse does not proceed from them, as was formerly believed, and as many still think; the first impulse comes from economic conditions.      sketching plans for the future social state is about as rational as writing in advance the history of the next war.      The most ideal, the most philosophic race that history has yet known, the only society of thinkers and artists devoted to science and art for their own sakes, was the Athenian aristocracy, the slave-holding landlords of Athens.      Economic development has advanced since those days. The division of labor has reached a point undreamt of, and the system of production for sale has driven many of the former exploiters and people of culture into the class of producers. Like the mechanics and farmers, the rich also are wholly taken up with their business. They do not now assemble in gymnasiums and academies, but in stock exchanges and markets. The speculations in which they are absorbed do not concern questions of truth and justice, but the prices of wool and whiskey, bonds and coupons. These are the speculations that consume their mental energies. After this “labor” they have neither strength nor taste for any but the most commonplace amusements.      On the other hand, as far as the cultured classes are concerned, their education has become a merchandise. They, too, have neither time nor inclination for disinterested search for truth, for striving after the ideal. Each buries himself in his specialty and considers every moment lost which is spent in learning anything which cannot be turned into money. Hence the movement to abolish Greek and Latin from the secondary schools. Whatever the pedagogic grounds may be for this movement, the teal reason is the desire to have the youth taught only what is “useful,” that is, what can be turned into money. Even among scientific men and artists the instinct after a harmonious development is perceptibly losing ground. On all sides specialists are springing up. Science and art are degraded to the level of a trade. What Socrates said of ancient handicraft now holds good of these pursuits. The philosophic way of looking at things is on the decline – that is, within the classes here considered.      The second result is that he is driven to revolt against excessive hours of work. To him labor is not identical with life; life commences only when labor is at an end. For working-men to whom labor and life were identical, freedom of labor meant freedom of life. The workingman, who lives only when he does not work, can enjoy a free life only by being free from labor. As a matter of course, the efforts of this class of workers cannot be directed to freeing themselves from all labor. Labor is the condition of life. But their efforts will necessarily be directed toward reducing their hours of labor far enough to leave them time to live.           Karl Kautsky, Class Struggle (https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1892/erfurt/ch04.htm)      Otto Neurath - Ch. 14 - Socialist Utility - Economic Writings      https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/technology/facebook-tinkers-with-users-emotions-in-news-feed-experiment-stirring-outcry.html  In an academic paper published in conjunction with two university researchers, the company reported that, for one week in January 2012, it had altered the number of positive and negative posts in the news feeds of 689,003 randomly selected users to see what effect the changes had on the tone of the posts the recipients then wrote.  Although academic protocols generally call for getting people’s consent before psychological research is conducted on them, Facebook didn’t ask for explicit permission from those it selected for the experiment. It argued that its 1.28 billion monthly users gave blanket consent to the company’s research as a condition of using the service.  —-  It was in 2002, Zubo argues, that everything changed. This was the year that Google discovered what she calls “behavioral surplus”—forms of data useful for something other than improving products and services. In Google’s case, the purpose was to generate its first profitable business model: the sale of behavior- ally targeted ads.35 Google’s profits today are almost exclusively from such ad- vertising36 and the market it has constructed to sell these ads is mind-boggling.  It is by generalizing from Google’s trajectory that Zubo derives her defini- tions of surveillance capitalism. In this new mode, people are not users whom companies seek to serve but “objects from which raw materials are extracted and expropriated.”  “If Google is a search company, why is it investing in smart-home devices, wearables, and self-driving cars? If Facebook is a social network, why is it devel- oping drones and augmented reality?”41 In fact, she argues, they are driven “to hunt and capture raw material,” and the key move today is off the internet. She quotes Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt:  The internet will disappear. There will be so many IP addresses . . . so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing, things that you are interacting with, that you won’t even sense it. It will be part of your presence all the time. Imagine you walk into a room and the room is dynamic.  Here, for example, is the CEO of an “emotion scanning” firm: “[I]n the future, we’ll as- sume that every device just knows how to read your emotions.”61  technologies of the present facilitate a new paradigm of private power—one that appropriates our data for profit, dom- inated by a few companies that create significant new threats to our autonomy.

This idea of market autonomy—indeed, the very idea of a separate realm called “the economy”—is rooted in a series of powerful conceptual distinctions that were encoded in legal systems as capitalism emerged. One is the distinction between “private” and “public” realms, the former denoting the realm of the “economy” and the latter of “politics.”111 In legal orders, these distinctions are encoded in rules that construct distinct realms of private power (for example, through rules of property and contract) and a separate, insulated realm of state or public power.112  The realist critique helped bring about an end to laissez-faire as a reigning constitutional ideology, but the division between politics and the economy has reappeared in new guises. This is not, in fact, surprising, given the centrality of the idea of a distinct “economy” that follows its own rules to capitalist order. As colleagues and I describe in a forthcoming Yale Law Journal Feature, the intellec- tual tradition of law and economics has helped to reconstruct the distinction on new normative terrain.120 In laissez-faire, the mandate of noninterference was described as an expression of natural-law principles of liberty, rooted in concep- tions of the divine. The realists showed that modern markets are shot through with the coercive power of the state and that the legitimate use of the state— whether through enforcement of market rules or others—required “some nor- mative theory of what forms of coercive constraints society wished to prohibit and what forms to allow.”121 Law and economics reconstructed the poli- tics/economy distinction through precisely such a normative theory—the appeal to “efficiency.”  Efficiency here is described as a virtue because it provides a technical, neutral means to improve wealth in the economic sector, which (it is posited) can be later redistributed to address other normative goals, such as fairness.122 E - ciency in this rubric is typically defined through the “Kaldor-Hicks” criteria, rec- ommending any action that would increase overall consumer and producer sur- plus, so that in theory the winner could compensate the loser.  Cohen’s object of study is “informational capitalism.”132 Capitalism, here, “‘is oriented toward profit-maximizing, that is, toward increasing the amount of surplus appropriated by capital on the basis of the private control over the means of production and circulation,’ while informationalism ‘is oriented . . . toward the accumulation of knowledge and towards higher levels of complexity in in- formation processing.’”133 She advocates for this organizing concept over nar- rower formulations such as surveillance capitalism because it trains our focus on “the underlying transformative importance of the sociotechnical shi  to infor- mationalism as a mode of development.”134 She owes the formulation to Manuel Castells and his influential book, The Rise of the Network Society.135 How much surplus the capitalist mode of production produces, Castells argues, depends on productivity levels, which in turn respond to “modes of development”—mean- ing “the technological arrangements through which labor works on matter.”136 In di erent eras, di erent modes of development have prevailed: in the agricul- tural era, most important was the use of land and labor.137 In the industrial era, productivity gains were centrally keyed to the uses and distribution of new en- ergy sources.138 In our informational mode of development, “the source of productivity lies in the technology of knowledge generation, information pro- cessing, and symbol communication.”139 It is thus “the action of knowledge upon knowledge itself [that is] the main source of productivity.”140      1468 “The Law of Informational Capitalism,” Amy Kapcynski, Yale Law Review  Manuel Castells has been one of the first intellectuals to grasp the internet and its associated developments within a broader social theory. In his magnum opus The Information Age (1996, 1997, 2000) Castells presents his concept of the network society: a new emerging society that is connected by ubiquitous information and communication technologies (ICTs). Driven by these ICTs, Castells observes the formation of a new kind of capitalism that he calls “global informational capitalism”, or in short “informationalism”. This new system is characterized by the processing of knowledge and information through technologies. Networks constitute a pivotal element of this new socio-economic arrangement and represent the organizational logic of society. Networks are defined as “a set of interconnected nodes” that follow very adaptable, open-ended and decentralized structures (Castells, 1996, p. 470).      While in former times, individuals such as the entrepreneur, or collectives such as social classes, have been the efficacious economic actors, it is now networks that shape society foremost. Financial markets, companies, the media, political, cultural or other institutions are bound to the “networking logic”.  “(D)ominant functions are organized in networks pertaining to a space of flows that links them up around the world, while fragmenting subordinate functions, and people, in the multiple space of places, made of locales increasingly segregated and disconnected from each other” (ibid., p. 476).  Cultural codes, value, and power are produced and decided in a “meta-network” that “increasingly appears to most people as a meta-social disorder”. It is experienced as a “random sequence of events” following an “uncontrollable logic”, which changes human experience fundamentally (ibid., p. 477).  Opposing to essentially abstract and instrumental networks, identity serves as the main source of meaning for individuals in the prevailing order. Castells notes that “societies are increasingly structured around the bipolar opposition of the Net and the Self” (ibid., p. 3). Identity is resulting from tensions between these two poles.  The “power of flows takes precedence over the flows of power” (Castells, 1996, p. 469)  Castells argues that so called switchers, who in fact connect the networks “are the privileged instruments of power” and become “the fundamental sources in shaping, guiding and misguiding society”. The switchers hold real power in a system of inter-operating networks (ibid., p. 471). The ability to constitute, program and reprogram networks is another means to exercise power over others. Switchers and programmers are not constituted by single individuals or groups though, but of a network of decentralized, interconnected social actors. Power is therefore exercised in “a complex set of joint action” (Castells, 2009, p. 45). On a governmental level, this means that the nation-state has lost its ability to control the processes of cultural, economic, and social change. The network state emerges, who has to arrange itself with supranational institutions, multinational corporations, financial markets and other actors.  The emergence of the network society has been enabled by the pervasive implementation of ICTs. The new technologies took a key part in the restructuring of capitalism towards a global economy in the 1980s (Castells, 1996). The growth crisis of the economy in the 1970s was solved by opening up new markets of production and consumption on a global scale. Improved communication capabilities played a crucial factor. But another precondition for a global economy was the increased mobility of capital realized through financial deregulation. The rise of global informational capitalism was therefore enabled but not caused by new ICTs.  The “networked firm” can adapt better to the growing insecurities imposed by global, unclear markets. The spread of Japanese management techniques, lean and just-in-time production with their increased labor flexibility due to outsourcing and subcontracting are parts of this restructuring process. What was vertically and hierarchically organized before, is now replaced by a flexible, less-standardized networking logic.  ….However, at the same time, the automation and outsourcing of manufacturing is taking place, which leads to a divide between “upgraded” information work and “downgraded” precarious jobs (ibid., p. 251).  ….Global informational capitalism is, therefore, “characterized by a tendency towards increased social inequality and polarization” (Castells, 2000, p. 380). The global division of labor is producing winners that are highly skilled information workers, and losers that are downgraded service and informal workers, or even unemployed and thus, structurally excluded populations. These marginalized people are found in excluded regions, such as large parts of Africa, but also within developed countries, e.g. in ghettos.      ​​https://www.hiig.de/en/revisiting-castells-network-society/      Castells defines the concepts as follows: "The material arrangements that allow for simultaneity of social practices without territorial contiguity. It is not purely electronic space...It is made up first of all of a technological infrastructure of information systems, telecommunications, and transportation lines" (Castells, Manuel (2000): Grassrooting the Space of Flows, hg. von. James O. Wheeler, Yuko Aoyama und Barney Warf, London: Routledge, p.19).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_of_flows        Aims of life vary with each and every individual; and the more society is civilized, the more will individuality be developed, and the more will desires be varied.  And as all men do not and cannot resemble one another (the variety of tastes and needs is the chief guarantee of human progress) there will always be, and it is desirable that there should always be, men and women whose desire will go beyond those of ordinary individuals in some particular direction.  In our present, poor capitalistic society, the man who has artistic needs cannot satisfy them unless he is heir to a large fortune, or by dint of hard work appropriates to himself an intellectual capital which will enable him to take up a liberal profession. Still he cherishes the hopeof some day satisfying his tastes more of less, and for this reason he reproaches the idealist Communist societies with having the material life of each individual as their sole aim.--"In your communal stores you may perhaps have bread for all," he says to us, "but you will not have beautiful pictures, optical instruments, luxurious furniture, artistic jewelry--in short, the many things that minister to the infinite variety of human tastes. And in this way you suppress the possibility of obtaining anything besides the bread and meat which the commune can offer to all, and the grey linen in which all your lady citizens will be dressed."      http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/conquest/ch9.html    The proletariat seizes political power and turns the means of production into State property.      But, in doing this, it abolishes itself as proletariat, abolishes all class distinction and class antagonisms, abolishes also the State as State. Society, thus far, based upon class antagonisms, had need of the State. That is, of an organization of the particular class which was, pro tempore, the exploiting class, an organization for the purpose of preventing any interference from without with the existing conditions of production, and, therefore, especially, for the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited classes in the condition of oppression corresponding with the given mode of production (slavery, serfdom, wage-labor). The State was the official representative of society as a whole; the gathering of it together into a visible embodiment.      When, at last, it becomes the real representative of the whole of society, it renders itself unnecessary. As soon as there is no longer any social class to be held in subjection; as soon as class rule, and the individual struggle for existence based upon our present anarchy in production, with the collisions and excesses arising from these, are removed, nothing more remains to be repressed, and a special repressive force, a State, is no longer necessary.  The first act by virtue of which the State really constitutes itself the representative of the whole of society — the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society — this is, at the same time, its last independent act as a State. State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The State is not "abolished". It dies out. This gives the measure of the value of the phrase: "a free State", both as to its justifiable use at times by agitators, and as to its ultimate scientific insufficiency; and also of the demands of the so-called anarchists for the abolition of the State out of hand.          Who can say for sure that the deprivation which afflicts him with hunger is more painful than the deprivation which afflicts him with envy of his neighbor’s new car?      Consumer wants can have bizarre, frivolous, or even immoral origins, and an admirable case can still be made for a society that seeks to satisfy them. But the case cannot stand if it is the process of satisfying wants that creates the wants. For then the individual who urges the importance of production to satisfy these wants is precisely in the position of the onlooker who applauds the efforts of the squirrel to keep abreast of the wheel that is propelled by his own efforts.          Yet there is a certain solitude like no other - that of the man preparing his meal in public on a wall, or on the hood of his car, or along a fence, alone. You see that all the time here. It is the saddest sight in the world. Sadder than destitution, sadder than the beggar is the man who eats alone in public. Nothing more contradicts the laws of man or beast, for animals always do each other the honour of sharing or disputing each other’s food. He who eats alone is dead (but not he who drinks alone. Why is this?).  Jaen Baudrillard, America (1986)[edit]      The discourse of truth is quite simply impossible. It eludes itself. Everything eludes itself, everything scoffs at its own truth, seduction renders everything elusive. The fury to unveil the truth, to get at the naked truth, the one which haunts all discourses of interpretation, the obscene rage to uncover the secret, is proportionate to the impossibility of ever achieving this. …But this rage, this fury, only bears witness to the eternity of seduction and to the impossibility of mastering it. (p. 73)  The Ecstasy of Communication (1987)      Forgetting extermination is part of extermination, because it is also the extermination of memory, of history, of the social, etc. This forgetting is as essential as the event in any case unlocatable by us, inaccessible to us in its truth. This forgetting is still too dangerous, it must be effaced by an artificial memory (today, everywhere, it is artificial memories that effect the memory of man, that efface man in his own memory). This artificial memory will be the restaging of extermination - but late, much too late for it to be able to make real waves and profoundly disturb something, and especially, especially through medium that is itself cold, radiating forgetfulness, deterrence, and extermination in a still more systematic way, if that is possible, than the camps themselves.  Simulacra and Simulation (1981)      Nothing is wholly obvious without becoming enigmatic. Reality itself is too obvious to be true.  The Perfect Crime (1993)      The simulacrum now hides, not the truth, but the fact that there is none, that is to say, the continuation of Nothingness.  Radical Thought (1994)      To challenge and to cope with this paradoxical state of things, we need a paradoxical way of thinking; since the world drifts into delirium, we must adopt a delirious point of view. We must no longer assume any principle of truth, of causality, or any discursive norm. Instead, we must grant both the poetic singularity of events and the radical uncertainty of events. It is not easy. We usually think that holding to the protocols of experimentation and verification is the most difficult thing. But in fact the most difficult thing is to renounce the truth and the possibility of verification, to remain as long as possible on the enigmatic, ambivalent, and reversible side of thought.  The Vital Illusion (2000) "The Murder of the Real". Wellek Library Lectures given May 1999 at the University of California, Irvine      It is important to recognize that when we speak of house- work we are not speaking of a job as other jobs, but we are speaking of one of the most pervasive manipulations, most subtle and mystified forms of violence that capital- ism has perpetrated against any section of the working class.      In the same way as god created Eve to give pleasure to Adam, so did capital create the housewife to service the male worker physically, emotionally and sexually – to raise his children, mend his socks, patch up his ego when it is crushed by the work and the social rela- tions (which are relations of loneliness) that capital has reserved for him.      To say that we want wages for housework is to expose the fact that housework is already money for capital, that capital has made and makes money out of our cooking, smiling, fucking. At the same time, it shows that we have cooked, smiled, fucked throughout the years not because it was easier for us than for anybody else, but because we did not have any other choice. Our faces have become distorted from so much smiling, our feelings have got lost from so much loving, our over-sexualization has left us completely desexualized.      We want to call work what is work so that eventually we might rediscover what is love and create what will be our sexual- ity which we have never known. And from the viewpoint of work we can ask not one wage but many wages, because we have been forced into many jobs at once. We are house- maids, prostitutes, nurses, shrinks; this is the essence of the ‘heroic’ spouse who is celebrated on ‘Mother’s Day’. We say: stop celebrating our exploitation, our supposed heroism. From now on we want money for each moment of it, so that we can refuse some of it and eventually all of it.      As is often said – when the needs of the waged labour market require her presence there – A woman can do any job without losing her femininity,’ which simply means that no matter what you do you are still a cunt.      Silvia Federico, Wages Against Housework      The works of art of the ‘great boredom’ offered the opportunity to undergo something di cult, and there would come a point when they would have been ‘lived through’. The paradox was to offer the audience an achievement that was one of passivity. This would reveal something about an essential passivity, perhaps even a ‘passivity more passive than the passivity of activity’, as the philosopher Levinas put it.16 This passivity would not be a defective form of activity, with the latter given priority. It would have implications for the relation to oneself, to the world and to the other. Is it not this passivity that is occluded in the transition from the ‘great boredom’ to totalised distraction?      The necessity of wasting time has not changed. Indeed, it is even more urgent because of the total colonisation of time. Pretty much all our time has been rendered productive, although mostly not for us. This has been achieved through the monetisation of attention, made possible by the digital and the internet, social media and the development of smartphones, which lure attention during down moments, the times when in the past we might have been bored. Apparently, at one point, Candy Crush largely replaced the reading of novels on public transport.24 Now, no doubt, some other game transports commuters elsewhere. This ‘wasted time’ has been rendered productive for the global corporate economy, so we have to look somewhere else to  nd a waste that cannot be economised, if such a thing is even possible, according to the paradox of the potlatch identi ed by Bataille, that of turning waste itself into an acquisition.25      It is here that we might turn to the relation between boredom and bliss posited by Roland Barthes. We see this when, in the middle of an interminable meeting during the notorious trip to China by French intellectuals that led to the Maoist turn of the Parisian left, he is attracted by tea leaves unfolding in a cup.26 This is not a great boredom, but a mundane boredom, and the bliss, which he describes as an excess of the signi er, is a small bliss, and not a great fusion: a tiny moment of ecstatic waste in the midst of an instrumentalised administered world.              ather as outside of the work–leisure duality (which is also where we might want to situate boredom)  This wasteland seems to have been entirely gentrified today, converted into value. Wasting time has been made productive, just, as I said, not for us. More and more of the day has become wasted time where our attention is harvested. It is another form of expropriation. The problem we face is how to claim back our wasted time without instrumentalising it, without turning it into labour. A task for education, perhaps, not providing ‘job skills’ and preparing for lucrative employment but teaching the art of wasting time.          Being bored would therefore be a refusal to be absorbed by the recurrent new, for the sake of that which is awaited on the basis of interruption rather than the continuum of historicism. Boredom is in this respect a ‘great boredom’ because it is tied to – is the very mood of – the standpoint of redemption. Boredom is ‘the dream bird that hatches the egg of experience’, writes Benjamin, and, he adds, ‘A rustling in the leaves drives him away.’38  Benjamin and Heidegger’s accounts of boredom share a totalising operation, and it is arguably this that characterises the ‘great’ boredom.      ‘Semiocapitalism’ – consuming the signs of consumption; boring because it’s an abstraction of real consumer experience, supposedly universal      So long as the matter or substance of life, or at least aspects of it, remain un-totalised, not abstracted for the extraction of value, boredom can lead somewhere that is not boring.    The paradoxical shock value of art that’s boring – almost an endurance challenge      With the emergence of ‘semiocapitalism’ during the 1980s in what has become the ‘global North’ we see a shift from a ‘Fordist’ boredom, linked to repetitive and tedious labour and statist and corporate bureaucracy, to a new kind of all-pervasive boredom involving a general exhaustion and emptying out of significance.  The phase after this is described by Mark Fisher as ‘anhedonic boredom’ and he gives the example of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana: ‘In his dreadful lassitude and objectless rage, Cobain seemed to give wearied voice to the despondency of the generation that had come after history, whose every move was anticipated, tracked, bought and sold before it had even happened.      The expansion of abstraction and commodi cation into leisure and home life began to happen in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, picked up after the depression in the 1930s and accelerated during the post-war period, increasingly from the 1960s with the development of the advertising industry which – from at least the 1890s – lay behind this penetration of capital into consumption and the colonisation of private life. Distraction o ers itself as the solution to boredom, inevitably becoming boring itself.      We appear to be in a moment when the abstract (as formal relations of capitalist value extraction) has been allowed, as Finelli puts it, ‘to invade the concrete’77 with the result that everything becomes simultaneously attention-grabbing and boring, not in the ‘great’ sense of a duration endured for some kind of illumination, but with an endless, indefinite, low-level hum.      As the boredom of precarious labour that leads nowhere becomes more pervasive, boredom as an aesthetic stance comes to seem self-indulgent. What is in question is not stretching my time, but freeing the time of others, and that there be time at all.      The long stretches of lockdown have created new occasions for boredom, and also made explicit that the different kinds of boredom reflect social inequality, as they have done in the past, when the ennui of the monied is not the same as boredom with repetitive work. Generative boredom, if such can still occur, is the privilege of those who have the time and space for it.      The Long and Short of It: On Boredom (114)      Based on these notions, boredom has been portrayed as an unpleasant but ultimately functional emotion as it informs people of the mundaneness of their current circumstances and motivates people to escape from it in the pursuit of more worthwhile activity (e.g., Elpidorou, 2014, 2018a, 2018b, 2020; see also Bench & Lench, 2013, 2019; Van Tilburg & Igou, 2011, 2017a).      In accordance with research on meaning-regulation (e.g., Heine et al., 2006), boredom promotes the use of symbolic (i.e., cultural) sources of meaning as compensation for meaninglessness, such as favouring one’s in-group and derogating an out-group (Van Tilburg & Igou, 2011), inspiring pro-social tendencies (Van Tilburg & Igou, 2017b), engaging in nostalgic reverie (Van Tilburg et al., 2013), affirming one’s own political ideologies (Van Tilburg & Igou, 2016) and affirmation of heroes (Coughlan et al., 2019). Meaning systems such as religion can also serve as a buffer against boredom experiences (Van Tilburg, Igou, Maher, Moynihan, & Martin , 2019).      Defences against the meaninglessness of boredom are not limited to engagement with sources of meaning, however. An alternative form of defence is based on one principle course of action in motivation and self-regulation: avoidance (e.g., Folkman et al., 1986) and the avoidance of unpleasant thoughts and feelings in particular (e.g., Baumeister, 1991). In social psychology literature, Wisman (2006) proposed the defence of “losing the self” by engaging in behaviours that prevent adverse self-awareness (Baumeister, 1988, 1990, 1991). By doing so, people can reduce awareness of a threat to meaning in life as an alternative to affirming worldviews or bolstering the self to deal with meaninglessness. According to this existential escape hypothesis, people may also use behaviours not specific to culture but that are more evolutionarily and developmentally more basic (e.g., eating, drinking, sex, anonymity in groups) to deal with existential anxieties. Wisman calls these behaviours presymbolic as people can enact them with little involvement of the symbolic capacities needed in the more advanced cultural world. Typically, hedonic and some interpersonal behaviours function as presymbolic resources.      https://journals-sagepub-com.revproxy.brown.edu/doi/full/10.1177/01461672221079104      Music fans had to wait 23 years for Pixies to bring out an album after Trompe le Monde, and while it only received modest reviews in the music press, snail fans were euphoric.

Pybus (2015, p. 239) considers the nature of these archives as an ‘important space of interpretation and contestation that has the power to make meaning through its ability to privilege certain discourse over others’.

The fact is that this wealth is collectively not individually produced, despite the persistence of an older economic imaginary that links individual production directly to consumption.5 Indeed, as Postone observes, "on a deep, systemic level, production is not for the sake of consumption" (1996, 184). The relationship may appear direct and incontrovertible, but it is in fact highly mediated: the goal of neither party in the work relation is consumption; one seeks surplus value, and the other income  http://libcom.org/files/the-problem-with-work_-feminism-marxism-kathi-weeks.pdf      ROSALIND, as Ganymede Nay, an you be so tardy,  come no more in my sight.

Here comes a pair of  very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called  fools.      Act 5, Scene 4      The  two-day weekend, for example, emerged spontaneously from workers’ predilection for drinking  and  spending  an  extra  day  recovering  rather  than  working.58  The  weekend’s  eventual  consolidation  as  a  recognised  and  bounded  period  of  time  off  was  the  product  of  sustained  political  struggles  (a  process  that  was  not  completed  in  the  Western  world  until  the  1970s).59          In  a  classic  statement,  Paul  Lafargue  argued  for  limiting  work  to  just  three  hours a day.63 Keynes famously argued for the same outcome, calculating that  by 2030 we would all be working fi fteen-hour working weeks – though it is  less  well  known  that  he  was  simply  verbalising  what  were  the  broadly  held  beliefs  of  the  time.64  And  Marx  made  the  shortening  of  the  working  week  central to his entire postcapitalist vision, arguing that it represented a ‘basic  prerequisite’ to reaching ‘the realm of freedom’.65  But  such  visions  of  a  three-hour  work  day  have  disappeared.  The  near  century-long push for shorter working hours ended abruptly during the Great  Depression,  when  business  opinion  and  government  policy  decided  to  use  make-work  programmes  in  response  to  unemployment.66  Soon  after  World  War II, the working week stabilised at forty hours across much of the Western  world, and there has since been little serious consideration of changing this.6      These  demands  mean  that  the  average  full-time  US worker in fact logs closer to forty-seven hours a week.71      Whether for a religious or secular goal, suffering  is  thought  to  constitute  a  necessary  rite  of  passage.  People  must  endure  through work before they can receive wages, they must prove their worthiness  before  the  eyes  of  capital.  This  thinking  has  an  obvious  theological  basis  –  where  suffering  is  thought  to  be  not  only  meaningful,  but  in  fact  the  very condition of meaning.
